    "# NEARCoder evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "NEARCoder, the Web3 Code LLM for the NEAR Protocol, is built on StarCoder2-3B. In this notebook, we are evaluating NEARCoder and its intermediary building steps in a structured testing protocol. Our primary hypothesis is that our final model doesn't lose performance to general coding tasks compared to the base model, while it increases its performance on specialized coding tasks related to the NEAR Protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Evaluation framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate the following four models:\n",
    "- [StarCoder2-3B](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder2-3b): The base model.\n",
    "- [NEAR-preTrainedStarCoder2](https://huggingface.co/jcarbonnell/NEAR-preTrainedStarCoder2): StarCoder2-3B pre-trained on NEAR-specific data.\n",
    "- [NEAR-structTunedStarCoder2](https://huggingface.co/jcarbonnell/NEAR-structTunedStarcoder2): Structurally tuned version of the pre-trained model.\n",
    "- [NEARCoder-3b](https://huggingface.co/jcarbonnell/NEARCoder-3b): The final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the following four tasks:\n",
    "- [HumanEvalPack](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/humanevalpack): an extension of OpenAI's general code challenges HumanEval with Javascript and Rust programming languages.\n",
    "- NEAR Protocol Questions: Specific NEAR-related questions.\n",
    "- dApp Trees Generation: Generating NEAR dApp structures with comments.\n",
    "- Basic NEAR dApp Development: Building a simple NEAR dApp (e.g. an event calendar on the NEAR blockchain).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task will have specific metrics to ensure a comprehensive evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HumanEvalPack: BLEU score.\n",
    "- NEAR Protocol Questions: BLEU, ROUGE-1.\n",
    "- dApp Trees Generation: Structural similarity, comment quality.\n",
    "- Basic NEAR dApp Development: Functionality, usability, and code quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Comparative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating each model on each tasks, we will perform a comparative analysis to identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance trends across models.\n",
    "- Areas where the NEARCoder excels or needs improvement.\n",
    "- Any trade-offs between general coding performance and NEAR-specific capabilities."

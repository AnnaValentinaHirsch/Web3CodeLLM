Font Awesome Free License
-------------------------

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.
Full Font Awesome Free license: https://fontawesome.com/license/free.

# Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons
packaged as SVG and JS file types.

# Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons
packaged as web and desktop font files.

# Code: MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and
non-icon files.

# Attribution
Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

# Brand Icons
All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these
trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by Font
Awesome, nor vice versa. **Please do not use brand logos for any purpose except
to represent the company, product, or service to which they refer.**

     * 10
     * '10%'
     * '10, 10'

<article id="intro" class="intro">
    <p>jQuery Flipster is a CSS3 3D transform-based jQuery plugin built to replicate the familiar 'cover flow' effect, but also supports a variety of styles. Not only is it gorgeous to look at, Flipster is also:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive</strong> Automatically centers and scales to fit the area provided.</li>
        <li><strong>Touch Friendly</strong> Swipe between items on touch devices without interrupting scroll.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight</strong> Javascript and CSS combined are only 5kb gzipped (13kb without gzip). Only dependency is jQuery.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable</strong> Four built in styles (coverflow, carousel, wheel and flat) with plenty of options to configure Flipster the way you want</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But don't take our word for it. Check out the demos below, or <a href="https://github.com/drien/jquery-flipster">download from GitHub</a> to try it yourself.</p>

/*
    Usage Note:
    -----------
    Do not use both ajaxSubmit and ajaxForm on the same form.  These
    functions are mutually exclusive.  Use ajaxSubmit if you want
    to bind your own submit handler to the form.  For example,

    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#myForm').on('submit', function(e) {
            e.preventDefault(); // <-- important
            $(this).ajaxSubmit({
                target: '#output'
            });
        });
    });

    Use ajaxForm when you want the plugin to manage all the event binding
    for you.  For example,

    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#myForm').ajaxForm({
            target: '#output'
        });
    });

    You can also use ajaxForm with delegation (requires jQuery v1.7+), so the
    form does not have to exist when you invoke ajaxForm:

    $('#myForm').ajaxForm({
        delegation: true,
        target: '#output'
    });

    When using ajaxForm, the ajaxSubmit function will be invoked for you
    at the appropriate time.

/**
 * ajaxForm() provides a mechanism for fully automating form submission.
 *
 * The advantages of using this method instead of ajaxSubmit() are:
 *
 * 1: This method will include coordinates for <input type="image" /> elements (if the element
 *    is used to submit the form).
 * 2. This method will include the submit element's name/value data (for the element that was
 *    used to submit the form).
 * 3. This method binds the submit() method to the form for you.
 *
 * The options argument for ajaxForm works exactly as it does for ajaxSubmit.  ajaxForm merely
 * passes the options argument along after properly binding events for submit elements and
 * the form itself.

	Setup
	=====

-->
			<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

			<p>
				You can install fancyBox by linking <code>.css</code> and <code>.js</code> to your html file.

				Make sure you also load the jQuery library.
				Below is a basic HTML template to use as an example:
			</p>

			<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;My page&lt;/title&gt;

	&lt;!-- CSS --&gt;
	&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;jquery.fancybox.min.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

	&lt;!-- Your HTML content goes here --&gt;

	&lt;!-- JS --&gt;
	&lt;script src=&quot;//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script src=&quot;jquery.fancybox.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

			<p><b>Tips</b>:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Make sure you add the jQuery library first</li>
				<li>If you already have jQuery on your page, you shouldn't include it second time</li>
				<li>Do not include both fancybox.js and fancybox.min.js files</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Downloading using Bower</h3>

			<p>
				You can install the latest version of fancyBox with the command:
			</p>

			<pre><code>bower install fancybox</code></pre>

			<p>
				This will install fancyBox to Bower's install directory, the default being <code>bower_components</code>. <br />
				Within <code>bower_components/fancybox/dist/</code> you will find an uncompressed release and a compressed release.
			</p>

			<h3>Using jQuery with a CDN</h3>
			
			<p>
				CDNJS CDN also host compressed and uncompressed versions of fancyBox - <br />
				<a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fancybox/" target="_blank">https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fancybox/</a>

<!--

	How To Use
	==========

-->
			<h2 id="usage">How to Use</h2>

			<p>
				There are a few ways you can use fancyBox.
			</p>

			<h3>Initialize with data attributes</h3>

			<p>
				The most basic way to use fancyBox is by adding the <code>data-fancybox</code> attribute to a link.
				A caption can be added using the <code>data-caption</code> attribute. Example:
			</p>

			<pre>&lt;a href="image.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="My caption"&gt;
	&lt;img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

			<p>
				If you have a group of items, you can use the same attribute <code>data-fancybox</code> value for each of them to create a gallery.
				Each group should have a unique value:
			</p>

			<pre>&lt;a href="image_1.jpg" data-fancybox="group" data-caption="Caption #1"&gt;
	&lt;img src="thumbnail_1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="image_2.jpg" data-fancybox="group" data-caption="Caption #2"&gt;
	&lt;img src="thumbnail_2.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

			<p>
				<b>Tip</b>:

				fancyBox attempts to automatically detect the type of content based on the given url.

				If it cannot be detected, the type can also be set manually using <code>data-type</code> attribute:

				<pre>&lt;a href="images.php?id=123" data-type="image" data-caption="Caption"&gt;
	Show image
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
			</p>

			<h3>Initialize with JavaScript</h3>

			<p>
				To bind fancyBox events on any element, select with a jQuery selector and call the <code>fancybox</code> method:
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
	$(&quot;[data-fancybox]&quot;).fancybox({
		// Options will go here
	});
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

			<h3>Manual calling of fancyBox</h3>

			<p>
				fancyBox can be activated at any point within Javascript and therefore does not necessarily need a trigger element.

				Example of displaying a simple message:
			</p>

			<pre><code>$.fancybox.open('&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hello!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');</code></pre>

			<p>
				See <a href="#api">API section</a> for more information.
			</p>

<!--

	Examples
	=========

-->
			<h2 id="media_types">Media types</h2>

			<h3 id="images">Images</h3>

			<p>
				The standard way of using fancyBox is with a number of thumbnail images that link to larger images:
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;a href="image.jpg" data-fancybox="images" data-caption="My caption"&gt;
	&lt;img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

			<p class="demo">
				<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/jyEGGG/?editors=1000" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				By default, fancyBox fully preloads an image before displaying it.
				You can choose to display the image right away.
				It will render and show the full size image while the data is being received.
				To do so, some attributes are necessary:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><code>data-width</code>  - the real width of the image</li>
				<li><code>data-height</code> - the real height of the image</li>
			</ul>

			<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;image.jpg&quot; data-fancybox=&quot;images&quot; data-width=&quot;2048&quot; data-height=&quot;1365&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;thumbnail.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
			<p class="demo">
				<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/wgBrXd?editors=1000" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				fancyBox supports "scrset" so I can display different images based on viewport width. You can use this to improve download times for mobile users and over time save bandwidth.
				Example:
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;medium.jpg&quot; data-fancybox=&quot;images&quot; data-srcset=&quot;large.jpg 1600w, medium.jpg 1200w, small.jpg 640w&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;thumbnail.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
			<p class="demo">
				<a href="https://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/bqbpbO?editors=1000" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				It is also possible to protect images from downloading by right-click.
				While this does not protect from truly determined users, it should discourage the vast majority from ripping off your files.
			</p>

			<pre><code>$('[data-fancybox]').fancybox({
	image : {
		protect: true
	}
});</code></pre>
			<p class="demo">
				<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/RKKqLx?editors=1010" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<h3 id="inline">Inline</h3>

			<p>
				For your Inline HTML you have to place a DIV Container into the content of the page:
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;div style=&quot;display: none;&quot; id=&quot;hidden-content&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;Hello&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;You are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

			<p>
				And then simply create a link using <code>data-src</code> attribute that matches CSS id selector of the element you want to open (<code>#hidden-content</code> in this example):
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;a data-fancybox data-src=&quot;#hidden-content&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;
	Hidden div
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
			<p class="demo">
				<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/MJYOOd?editors=1000" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<h3 id="ajax">Ajax</h3>

			<p>
				To load content via AJAX, you need to add a <code>data-type="ajax"</code> attribute to your link:
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;a data-fancybox data-type=&quot;ajax&quot; data-src=&quot;my_page.com/path/to/ajax/&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;
	AJAX content
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
			<p class="demo">
				<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/JEoOvK?editors=1100" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				Additionally it is possible to define a selector with the <code>data-selector</code> attribute to show only a part of the response. The selector can be any string, that is a valid jQuery selector:
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;a data-fancybox data-type=&quot;ajax&quot; data-src=&quot;my_page.com/path/to/ajax/&quot; data-selector=&quot;#two&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;
	AJAX content
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
			<p class="demo">
				<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/MJwWKz?editors=1100" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<h3 id="iframe">Iframe</h3>

			<p>
				If the content can be shown on a page, and placement in an iframe is not blocked by script or security configuration of that page,
				it can be presented in a fancyBox:
			</p>

			<pre><code>&lt;a data-fancybox data-src=&quot;http://codepen.io/fancyapps/full/jyEGGG/&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;
	Webpage
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a data-fancybox data-src=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;
	Sample PDF
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
			<p class="demo">
				<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/BpymvO?editors=1000" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				To access and control fancyBox in parent window from inside an iframe:
			</p>

			<pre><code>// Adjust iframe height according to the contents
parent.jQuery.fancybox.getInstance().update();

// Close current fancyBox instance
parent.jQuery.fancybox.getInstance().close();</code></pre>

			<p>
				Iframe dimensions can be controlled by CSS:
			</p>

			<pre><code>.fancybox-slide--iframe .fancybox-content {
	width  : 800px;
	height : 600px;
	max-width  : 80%;
	max-height : 80%;
	margin: 0;
}</code></pre>

			<p>
				These CSS rules can be overridden by JS, if needed:
			</p>

			<pre><code>$(&quot;[data-fancybox]&quot;).fancybox({
	iframe : {
		css : {
			width : '600px'
		}
	}
});</code></pre>

			<p>
				If you have not disabled iframe preloading (using an "preload" option), then the script will atempt to
				calculate content dimensions and will adjust width/height of iframe to fit with content in it.
				Keep in mind, that due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank">same origin policy</a>,
				there are some limitations.
			</p>

				<p>
					Plugin options / defaults are exposed in <code>$.fancybox.defaults</code> namespace so you can easily adjust them globally:

				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.defaults.speed = 600;</code></pre>

				<p>
					Custom options for each element individually can be set by adding a <code>data-options</code>
					attribute to the element.

					This attribute should contain the properly formatted JSON object:
				</p>

				<pre><code>&lt;a data-fancybox data-options='{&quot;caption&quot; : &quot;My caption&quot;, &quot;src : &quot;iframe.html&quot;}' href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;
	Open external page using iframe
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<!--

API
===

-->
				<h2 id="api">API</h2>

				<p>
					The fancyBox API offers a couple of methods to control fancyBox.

					This gives you the ability to extend the plugin and to integrate it with other web application components.
				</p>

				<h3 id="core_methods">Core methods</h3>

				<p>
					Core methods are methods which affect/handle instances:
				</p>

				<pre><code>// Close only the currently active or all fancyBox instances
$.fancybox.close( all );

// Open the fancyBox right away
$.fancybox.open( items, opts, index );
</code></pre>

				<p>
					When calling fancyBox manually, each group item should follow this pattern:
				</p>

				<pre><code>{
	src  : '' // Source of the content
	type : '' // Content type: image|inline|ajax|iframe|html (optional)
	opts : {} // Object containing item options (optional)
}
</code></pre>

				<p>
					Example of opening image gallery:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.open([
	{
		src  : '1_b.jpg',
		opts : {
			caption : 'First caption'
		}
	},
	{
		src  : '2_b.jpg',
		opts : {
			caption : 'Second caption'
		}
	}
], {
	loop : false
});</code></pre>
				<p class="demo">
					<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/wgZXzz?editors=1010" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					It is also possible to pass only one object. Example of opening inline content:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.open({
	src  : '#hidden-content',
	type : 'inline',
	opts : {
		onComplete : function() {
			console.info('done!');
		}
	}

				<p>
					If you wish to display some html content (for example, a message), then you can use a simpler syntax.
					It is advised to use a wrapper around your content.
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.open('&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hello!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');</code></pre>

				<h3 id="instance_methods">Instance methods</h3>

				<p>
					In order to use these methods, you need an instance of the plugin's object:
				</p>

				<pre><code>var $instance = $.fancybox.getInstance();</code></pre>

				<p>
					Or you can can just use fancyBox constructor:
				</p>

				<pre><code>var $instance = $(&quot;[data-fancybox]&quot;).fancybox();</code></pre>

				<p>
					Once you have a reference to fancyBox instance the following methods are available:
				</p>

				<pre><code>// Go to next gallery item
$instance.next( duration );

// Go to previous gallery item
$instance.previous( duration );

// Switch to the other gallery item; accepts integer argument (an index of the desired item)
$instance.jumpTo( index, duration );

// Check if current image dimensions are smaller than actual
$instance.isScaledDown();

// Scale image to the actual size of the image
$instance.scaleToActual( x, y, duration );

// Check if image dimensions exceed parent element
$instance.canPan();

// Scale image to fit inside parent element
$instance.scaleToFit( duration );

// Move slider to current position
// Update all slides (and their content) if needed
$instance.update( andSlides, andContent, duration );

// Update slide position and make content fit in slide if needed
$instance.updateSlide( slide, andContent );

// Update infobar values, navigation button states and reveal caption
$instance.updateControls( force );

// Load custom content into the slide
$instance.setContent( slide, content );

// Try to find and focus on the first focusable element
$instance.focus();

// Activates current instance, brings it to the front
$instance.activate();

// Close instance
$instance.close();
</code></pre>

				<p>
					You can also do something like this:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.getInstance().jumpTo(1);</code></pre>

				<p>
					or simply:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.getInstance('jumpTo', 1);</code></pre>

				<h3 id="events">Events</h3>

				<p>
					fancyBox fires several events.
				</p>

				<pre><code>beforeLoad	 : Before the content of a slide is being loaded
afterLoad    : When the content of a slide is done loading
beforeMove 	 : Before slide change transition starts
afterMove    : After slide change transition is complete
onComplete	 : When slide change is complete and content has been loaded

onInit	 	 : When instance has been initialized
beforeClose	 : Before instance is closed
afterClose	 : After instance has been closed
onActivate   : When instance is brought to front
onDeactivate : When other instance has been activated
</code></pre>

				<p>
					Event callbacks can be set as function properties of the options object passed to fancyBox initialization function:
				</p>

				<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
	$(&quot;[data-fancybox]&quot;).fancybox({
		onComplete: function( instance, slide ) {

			// Tip: Each event passes useful information within the event object:

			// Object containing references to interface elements
			// (background, buttons, caption, etc)
			// console.info( instance.$refs );

			// Current slide options
			// console.info( slide.opts );

			// Clicked element
			// console.info( slide.opts.$orig );

			// Reference to DOM element of the slide
			// console.info( slide.$slide );

		}
	});
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

				<p>
					Each callback receives two parameters - current fancyBox instance and current gallery object, if exists.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is also possible to attach event handler for all instances.
					To prevent interfering with other scripts, these events have been namespaced to <code>.fb</code>.
					These handlers receive 3 parameters - event, current fancyBox instance and current gallery object.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is an example of binding to the <code>onComplete</code> event:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$(document).on('onComplete.fb', function( e, instance, slide ) {
	// Your code goes here
});</code></pre>

				<p>
					If you wish to prevent closing of the modal, for example, if form is not validating, you can use <code>beforeClose</code>
					callback. Simply return <code>false</code>:
				</p>

				<pre><code>beforeClose : function( instance, current, e ) {
	if ( $('#my-field').val() == '' ) {
		return false;
	}
}
</code></pre>

				<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>

				<p>
					fancyBox code is split into several files (modules) that extend core functionality.
					You can build your own fancyBox version by excluding unnecessary modules, if needed.
					Each one has their own <code>js</code> and/or <code>css</code> files.
				</p>

				<p>
					Some modules can be customized and controlled programmatically.
					List of all possible options:
				</p>

				<pre><code>slideShow : {
	speed : 3000 // Slideshow speed in ms
},
touch : {
	vertical : true // Allow vertical swipe
},
thumbs : {
	showOnStart   : false, // Display thumbnails on opening
	hideOnClosing : true   // Hide thumbnail grid when closing animation starts
},
fullScreen : {
	requestOnStart : false // Request fullscreen mode on opening
},
hash : false // Hash value</code></pre>

				<p>
					Example (show thumbnails on start):
				</p>

				<pre><code>$('[data-fancybox="images"]').fancybox({
	thumbs : {
		showOnStart : true
	}
})</code></pre>
				<p class="demo">
					<a href="https://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/RKKVVa?editors=1010" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					If you would inspect fancyBox instance object, you would find keys that names ar captialized - these are references for each module object.
					Also, you would notice that fancyBox uses common naming convention to prefix jQuery objects with <code>$</code>.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is how you, for example, can access thumbnail grid element:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.getInstance().Thumbs.$grid</code></pre>

				<p>
					This example shows how to call method that toggles thumbnails:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.getInstance().Thumbs.toggle();</code></pre>

				<p>
					List of available methods:
				</p>

				<pre><code>Thumbs.focus()
Thumbs.close();
Thumbs.update();
Thumbs.hide();
Thumbs.show();
Thumbs.toggle();

FullScreen.request( elem );
FullScreen.exit();
FullScreen.toggle( elem );
FullScreen.isFullscreen();
FullScreen.enabled();

SlideShow.start();
SlideShow.stop();
SlideShow.toggle();
</code></pre>

				<p>
					If you wish to disable hash module, use this snippet (after including JS file):
				</p>

				<pre><code>$.fancybox.defaults.hash = false;</code></pre>

FAQ
===

-->
				<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

				<h3>Opening/closing causes fixed element to jump</h3>

				<p>
					Simply add <code>compensate-for-scrollbar</code> CSS class to your fixed positioned elements.
					Example of using Bootstrap navbar component:
				</p>

				<pre><code>&lt;nav class=&quot;navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top compensate-for-scrollbar&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
		..
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>

				<p>
					The script measures width of the scrollbar and creates <code>compensate-for-scrollbar</code> CSS class
					that uses this value for <code>margin-right</code> property.
					Therefore, if your element has <code>width:100%</code>, you should positon it using <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> properties instead. Example:
				</p>

				<pre><code>.navbar {
	position: fixed;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
}</code></pre>

				<h3>How to customize caption</h3>

				<p>
					You can use <code>caption</code> option that accepts a function and is called for each group element. Example of appending image download link:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$( '[data-fancybox]' ).fancybox({
	caption : function( instance, item ) {
		var caption, link;

		if ( item.type === 'image' ) {
			caption = $(this).data('caption');
			link    = '&lt;a href=&quot;' + item.src + '&quot;&gt;Download image&lt;/a&gt;';

			return (caption ? caption + '&lt;br /&gt;' : '') + link;
		}
	}
});</code></pre>
				<p class="demo">
					<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/ygeYGx?editors=1010" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					Inside <code>caption</code> method, <code>this</code> refers to the clicked element. Example of using different source for caption:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$( '[data-fancybox]' ).fancybox({
	caption : function( instance, item ) {
		return $(this).find('figcaption').html();
	}
});</code></pre>

				</p>

				<h3>How to create custom button in the toolbar</h3>

				<p>
					Example of using callback to access toolbar element and append custom button:
				</p>

				<pre><code>$( '[data-fancybox]' ).fancybox({
	onInit : function( instance ) {
		instance.$refs.downloadButton = $('&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox-button fancybox-download&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;')
			.appendTo( instance.$refs.buttons );
	},
	beforeMove: function( instance, current ) {
		instance.$refs.downloadButton.attr('href', current.src);
	}
});

</code></pre>

				<p class="demo">
					<a href="http://codepen.io/fancyapps/pen/dNGapJ" target="_blank">View demo on CodePen</a>
				</p>

				<h3>How to reposition thumbnail grid</h3>

				<p>
					There is currenty no JS option to change thumbnail grid position.
					But fancyBox is designed so that you can use CSS to change position or dimension for each block
					(e.g., content area, caption or thumbnail grid).
					This gives you freedom to completely change the look and feel of the modal window, if needed.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at social@near.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

# Contributing to NEAR

NEAR welcomes help in many forms including development, code review, documentation improvements, and outreach.
Please visit [the contribution overview](https://docs.near.org/docs/community/contribute/contribute-overview) for more information.

## Using Github issues and pull requests

Some repositories have specific issue templates that will be helpful for maintainers and community contributors. Please use the templates whenever available.

Please include steps to reproduction, if reporting an error. Information on all applicable versions is quite helpful. Some versions can be found using the command line. (For example: `node --version` or `rustc --version`.) Other version information may be packaged as dependencies. (For example: in `package.json` or `Cargo.toml`.)

If there are verbosity flags available, please include those to offer as much information as possible.

When opening a pull request, please use the typical open-source flow of forking the desired repository and opening a pull request from your forked repository. (More information on [how to contribute](https://docs.near.org/docs/community/contribute/how-to-contribute).)

## Testing

Please note that for technical contributions, NEAR runs a battery of continuous integration tools and tests for each pull request.

It's encouraged to write unit tests on new features. Many NEAR repositories have built-in scripts that run tests locally. Tests may check linting and must be addressed.

For example, a repository might have `npm test` available. It's a good idea to run tests locally before submitting a pull request, as these will be caught during the CI process.

### Thank you

NEAR values all contributors to the projects in the ecosystem and invites public discussion on the tech and vision. Please feel free to join the conversation using the links offered at [near.help](https://near.help).

# Create NEAR App
===============
[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nearprotocol/create-near-app) 

Quickly build apps backed by the [NEAR](https://near.org) blockchain

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed – we are targeting versions `16+`.

Read about other [prerequisites](https://docs.near.org/develop/prerequisites) in our docs.

## Getting Started

To create a new NEAR project run this and follow interactive prompts:

    npx create-near-app

> If you've previously installed `create-near-app` globally via `npm install -g create-near-app`, please uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-near-app` to ensure that `npx` always uses the latest version.

Follow the instructions in the README.md in the project you just created! 🚀

You can create contracts written in:

- [JavaScript](https://docs.near.org/develop/quickstart-guide)
- [Rust](https://docs.near.org/develop/prerequisites)
- AssemblyScript

You can create a frontend template in:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Vanilla JavaScript

For testing we use a sandboxed environment of NEAR (called Workspaces).
You can write the tests in JavaScript or Rust.

### Using CLI arguments to run `create-near-app`

This CLI supports arguments to skip interactive prompts:

```shell
npx create-near-app
  <project-name>
  --contract js|rust|assemblyscript
  --frontend vanilla|react|none
  --tests js|rust
  --install
```

Use `--install` to automatically install dependencies from all `package.json` files.

When using arguments, all arguments are required, except for `--install`.

## Getting Help

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.near.org) or chat with us on [Discord](http://near.chat). We'd love to hear from you!

## Contributing to `create-near-app`

To make changes to `create-near-app` itself:

* clone the repository (Windows users, [use `git clone -c core.symlinks=true`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42137273/249801))
* in your terminal, enter one of the folders inside `templates`, such as `templates/vanilla`
* now you can run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to run the local development server, just like you can in a new app created with `create-near-app`

#### About commit messages

`create-near-app` uses semantic versioning and auto-generates nice release notes & a changelog all based off of the commits. We do this by enforcing [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

    type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")

Real world examples can look like this:

    chore: run tests with GitHub Actions

    fix(server): send cors headers

    feat(blog): add comment section

If your change should show up in release notes as a feature, use `feat:`. If it should show up as a fix, use `fix:`. Otherwise, you probably want `refactor:` or `chore:`. [More info](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint)

#### Deploy `create-near-app`

If you want to deploy a new version, you will need two prerequisites:

1. Get publish-access to [the NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/near-api-js)
2. Get write-access to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/near/near-api-js)
3. Obtain a [personal access token](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens) (it only needs the "repo" scope).
4. Make sure the token is [available as an environment variable](https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.md) called `GITHUB_TOKEN`

Then run one script:

    npm run release

Or just `release-it`

Hello NEAR!
===========

A [smart contract] written in [AssemblyScript] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install [Node.js] ≥ 16

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `assembly/index.ts`.
2. There are two functions to the smart contract: `get_greeting` and `set_greeting`.
3. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `npm run test` script. This runs
   standard AssemblyScript tests using [as-pect].

  [create-near-app]: https://github.com/near/create-near-app
  [Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

Hello NEAR!
=================================

A [smart contract] written with [NEAR JavaScript SDK] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Deploy to NEAR TestNet with a temporary dev account: `npm run deploy`

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The smart contract code is in `src/contract.ts`.
2. There are two functions to the smart contract: `get_greeting` and `set_greeting`.
3. Tests: Use integration-tests that `create-near-app` created for you.

  [smart contract]: https://docs.near.org/develop/welcome
  [NEAR JavaScript SDK]: https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js
  [create-near-app]: https://github.com/near/create-near-app

Hello NEAR!
=================================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`.
2. There are two functions to the smart contract: `get_greeting` and `set_greeting`.
3. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `cargo test`.

  [smart contract]: https://docs.near.org/develop/welcome
  [Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
  [create-near-app]: https://github.com/near/create-near-app
  [correct target]: https://docs.near.org/develop/prerequisites#rust-and-wasm
  [cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html

        <li>
          Ultimately, this <code>contract</code> code is defined in <code>assembly/main.ts</code> – this is the source code for your <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview">smart contract</a>.</li>
        <li>
          When you run <code>npm run dev</code>, the code in <code>assembly/main.ts</code> gets deployed to the NEAR testnet. You can see how this happens by looking in <code>package.json</code> at the <code>scripts</code> section to find the <code>dev</code> command.</li>

      Look at that! A Hello World app! This greeting is stored on the NEAR blockchain. Check it out:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Look in <code>index.js</code> and <code>near-api.js</code> – you'll see <code>get_greeting</code>
        and <code>set_greeting</code> being called on <code>contract</code>.
        What's this?
      </li>
      <li>
        Ultimately, this <code>contract</code> code is defined in
        <code>assembly/index.ts</code> – this is the source code for your
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview">smart contract</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you run <code>npm run dev</code>, the code in
        <code>assembly/index.ts</code> gets deployed to the NEAR testnet. You
        can see how this happens by looking in <code>package.json</code> at the
        <code>scripts</code> section to find the <code>dev</code> command.

near-blank-project
==================

This app was initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

If you haven't installed dependencies during setup:

    npm install

Build and deploy your contract to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy

Test your contract:

    npm test

If you have a frontend, run `npm start`. This will run a dev server.

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The smart-contract code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info. In blockchain apps the smart contract is the "backend" of your app.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/frontend/index.js`,
   this is your entrypoint to learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Test your contract: `npm test`, this will run the tests in `integration-tests` directory.

Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. 
When you run `npm run deploy`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a temporary dev account.
When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how:

Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `npm install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: deploy the contract
---------------------------

Use the CLI to deploy the contract to TestNet with your account ID.
Replace `PATH_TO_WASM_FILE` with the `wasm` that was generated in `contract` build directory.

    near deploy --accountId near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --wasmFile PATH_TO_WASM_FILE

Step 3: set contract name in your frontend code
-----------------------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet'

Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.

# Contribution Guidelines for DevHub Repos

## Introduction
At DevHub, we value the contributions of each individual. This document provides an overview of the developer setup and deployment process to help you contribute to our project. We also recommend familiarizing yourself with [how we work](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/blob/main/docs/how-we-work.md) to learn about our development process and enhance your contribution experience.

## Developer Setup

You can set up everything manually as described further down, or you can use the dev container setup which has everything out of the box and will get you started quickly.

### Using a dev container

This project is configured for developing with github codespaces or a locally hosted [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/). If using one of these options you get all the dev setup you need out of the box, and you don't have to spend time on installing any dependencies.

Once your dev container is started you can run the test suite, which is a good check to verify that all is running as expected:

`npm run test:watch:codespaces`

This will give you a web interface for all the tests, and you can run them to see how everything is expected to work. You should also use the test suite when developing new functionality, as it is a much more efficient workflow for the testing and development iterations. Also it prevents future regression if you develop the test driven way.

If your work requires changes to the developer setup, you should also include and test them in the devcontainer setup so that this is always up to date.

### Prerequisites

Before you start contributing to neardevhub-widgets, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- [`bos` CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs)

To familiarize yourself with the NEAR Social platform, we recommend reviewing the [NEAR Social Documentation](https://thewiki.near.page/PastPresentAndFutureOfNearSocial), since the JSX files in this repository are NEAR Social components.

You can also explore a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard-widgets/contribute) to get familiar with potential work items.

### Installation

We use `npm` and scripts in `package.json` to automate common developer tasks, so you will need NodeJS and then install project dependencies as usual:

```sh
npm install
```

### Development

#### Run the dev script

To initiate the development environment, you can use the following script. This script will first check if bos-loader is installed and, if not, install it. Then, it will serve the default development environment.

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Customizing Creator ID, Contract ID, or Network

If you need to customize the account ID, override the contract ID, or specify a different network for your development environment, you can use the following flags:

-a or --account: Specify the desired account ID.
-c or --contract: Override the default contract ID.
-n or --network: Set the network environment.

Here's how you can use these flags:

```sh
npm run dev -a your_account_id -c your_contract_id -n your_network
```

For example:

```sh
npm run dev -a bob.near -c contract.bobs.near -n mainnet
```

By using these flags, you have the flexibility to customize the development environment according to your specific needs.

#### Developing across multiple environments

When referencing a component or any parameter that depends on the network, please use the placeholders defined in replacements.*.json. There are three such files that correspond to different environments:

`replacements.dev.json` - deploys the develop branch, to testnet @ test.beta.near.org 

`replacements.testnet.json` - deploys main branch, to testnet @ test.near.org

`replacements.mainnet.json` - deploys main branch to mainnet @ near.org

Placeholders should be encapsulated in the ${} expression. Here is an example of a placeholder usage:

`<Widget src={homepage ?? "${REPL_ACCOUNT}/widget/ActivityPage"} />`

Placeholders are replaced with the target values specified in replacements.json when github actions deploys the components.

Feel free to specify a new placeholder if needed. The placeholder should have a REPL prefix, for example: `REPL_PROJECT_NAME`

A new placeholder should be defined for all three environments: dev-testnet, prod-testnet and prod-mainnet.

### Deployment

#### Deploy for Local Development and Testing

Currently, there is no local development environment, so we use [testnet NEAR Social](https://test.near.social) to deploy widgets and test them out during your development.

Before deploying the widgets you need to make the needed replacements with references to the account that will host the widgets:

```
npm run build:preview -- -a devgovgigs.petersalomonsen.near -c devgovgigs.near
```

Then make sure you stay in the `build` directory when deploying

```
cd build
```

To deploy the widgets, we use [`bos` CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs). Start with this command and follow the interactive questionnaire:

```
bos components deploy
```

After successful deployment, you will see a full command that could be used to re-deploy the widgets without interactive questionnaire, like this:

```
bos components deploy gigs.frol14.testnet sign-as gigs.frol14.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-macos-keychain send
```

Yours will not be exactly the same as this one. Please copy the printed command for a quick deployment next time.

Once deployed, open `gigs-board.pages.Feed` widget on your account on testnet NEAR Social:

```
https://test.near.social/#/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/widget/gigs-board.pages.Feed?nearDevGovGigsContractAccountId=gigs.frol14.testnet
```

NOTE: If you have [DevHub contract](https://github.com/near/neardevhub-contract) deployed to the same account, you can skip the `nearDevGovGigsContractAccountId` argument, otherwise, feel free to use the contract deployed to `gigs.frol14.testnet` (on testnet) or `devgovgigs.near` (on mainnet).

#### Deploy for Production

There is GitHub Actions automation that deploys all the widgets to [`devgovgigs.near` account](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/MyPage?accountId=devgovgigs.near) on mainnet on every push to the main branch.
Thus, once a PR is merged, you should see the new version of the widgets on [DevHub](https://neardevhub.org) in less than 15 seconds.

### Before Publishing
Before publishing, make sure that you’ve go through this section.

#### Code Style and Formatting

We use `prettier` to unify formatting. Run the following command to format your code:

```
npm run fmt
```

#### Writing tests

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for tests, which are located in the [playwright-tests](./playwright-tests/) folder. For each change or addition to the codebase you should also make sure that your changes are covered by tests in order to ensure that other developers will not break it in the future. Also you should write tests to accelerate your own development, so that you don't have to do manual coding/test interations via the browser.

Use the [dev-container](#using-a-dev-container) setup mentioned above for getting quick access to a complete development environment with test dependencies included, or see the [test-pipeline](./.github/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml) for what dependencies that needs to be installed on your workstation for tests to run.

Currently, none of the tests post actual transactions to the smart contracts. Still you should try writing your tests so that they do the actual function call, but just skip the final step of sending the transaction. You can do this by capturing the transaction confirmation popup provided by the NEAR social VM.

Here is an example snippet to capture the VM confirmation popup:

```javascript
const transactionObj = JSON.parse(
    await page.locator("div.modal-body code").innerText()
);
```

This will parse the text contents into the javascript object that we here call `transactionObj`. You can then make assertions on the properties. See the test called "should edit a community" in [community.spec.js](./playwright-tests/tests/community.spec.js) for a full example.

##### Creating test videos

In [playwright.config.js](./playwright.config.js) there's the `use` section where you find the `video` property.

For generating test videos when you run the tests, set the `video` property to `on`:

![Playwright video config](./docs/images/playwrightconfigvideo.png)

Then run a test, the simplest is to run it using the Playwright vs code plugin:

![Running a test with the Playwright vscode plugin](./docs/images/playwrightruntest.png)

After running you can find the video in the [test-results](./test-results/) folder.

#### Storage Deposit

Sometimes there is a need to deposit extra tokens to cover the widgets’ storage cost. You can do that with [`bos` CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs):

```
bos social-db prepaid-storage deposit
```

NOTE: `bos` CLI will interactively ask all the rest of the details to prepare the transaction.

Developing with the "Don't ask again" feature
=============================================

NEAR BOS has the "Don't ask again" feature on transactions for changes to SocialDB, or calling any contract. For an optimal user experience in BOS applications, both the transaction confirmation dialog, and transactions being executed without confirmation ( when the "Don't ask again" feature is enabled ), should be handled.

When executing a transaction that does not confirm with the wallet, it is important to make the user aware of the ongoing transaction. NearSocialVM will show a toast in the bottom right, informing that a transaction is in process, but it might take time for this to appear, and also it does disappear when the transaction is complete, but still the page might not have been fully refreshed.

We would like to avoid that the user double clicks any submit or like button, so then we should ensure that the button is disabled immediately once cliked. Also there should be an loading indicator on the button, like a spinner.

After the transaction is complete, we would not want the user to think that a page reload is needed, so we still have to keep the loading indicator spinning, until VM cache invalidation occurs. Calling a view method on the changed data should ensure that we get fresh data, on cache invalidation, and then we can also remove the loading indicator.

An example of this is when posting community Announcements, that use the `devhub.entity.community.Compose` widget for editing and posting the announcement data. Here's how it references the widget:

```jsx
 <Widget
    src={"${REPL_DEVHUB}/widget/devhub.entity.community.Compose"}
    props={{
    onSubmit: (v) => {
        setSubmittedAnnouncementData(v);
        setCommunitySocialDB({ handle, data: v });
    },
    profileAccountId: `${handle}.community.${REPL_DEVHUB_CONTRACT}`,
    isFinished: () => submittedAnnouncementData === null,
    }}
/>
```

Notice the `onSubmit` handler where we call the `setSubmittedAnnouncementData` state method, and set it to the submitted value. Then we have the `isFinished` handler which will check if it is set back to `null`. `isFinished` is called by the Compose widget to see if it can remove the loading spinner indicator.

For setting the `submittedAnnouncementData` back to `null`, there is `useEffect` statement that triggers when it is set by the `onSubmit` handler:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (submittedAnnouncementData) {
    const checkForAnnouncementInSocialDB = () => {
      Near.asyncView("${REPL_SOCIAL_CONTRACT}", "get", {
        keys: [`${communityAccountId}/post/**`],
      }).then((result) => {
        try {
          const submittedAnnouncementText = JSON.parse(
            submittedAnnouncementData.post.main
          ).text;
          const lastAnnouncementTextFromSocialDB = JSON.parse(
            result[communityAccountId].post.main
          ).text;
          if (submittedAnnouncementText === lastAnnouncementTextFromSocialDB) {
            setSubmittedAnnouncementData(null);
            return;
          }
        } catch (e) {}
        setTimeout(() => checkForAnnouncementInSocialDB(), 1000);
      });
    };
    checkForAnnouncementInSocialDB();
  }
}, [submittedAnnouncementData]);
```

As you can see this is calling `social.get` to check if the latest post text matched the text we submitted. As long as it does not, we assume the transaction has not completed, and we have a `setTimeout` to try again one second later. If it matches we set the `submittedAnnouncementData` back to null, which will then also signal the Compose component to remove the loading spinner, and re-enable the submit button.

# Limitations of BOS loader

When developing locally, it is popular to use the BOS loader in combination with `flags` on https://near.org/flags pointing to your local development environment hosted by BOS loader. Unfortunately BOS is not able to detect your widget for the transaction confirmation, and so "Don't ask again" will not work. In order to test "Don't ask again" when working locally, you rather need to mock the responses of RPC calls to fetch your locally stored widgets. This can be done using Playwright, and you can see an example of such a mock in [bos-loader.js](../../playwright-tests/util/bos-loader.js). Using this approach `flags` is not used, but instead your playwright test browser, when it calls to RPC for the widget contents, will receive the contents served by your local BOS loader.

# How we work

Welcome to our community of DevHub contributors! Our main goal is to deliver impact features that help developers thrive and contribute to the NEAR ecosystem. This document provides an overview of how we collaborate across different time zones using lightweight and mostly asynchronous processes. 

## Agreements

As contributors, we believe we can all succeed when we embrace these principles:

* **Ownership & Code Quality**: Take full ownership of assigned issues, delivering high-quality code. Adhere to our developer workflow and limit work in-progress to two issues at a time.

* **Participation & Support**: Participate daily by promptly responding to requests and supporting fellow contributors.

* **Visibility & Organization**: Maintain visibility on your progress by keeping tickets up to date. Additionally, contribute to triaging tickets to maintain an organized backlog.

* **Code Review**: Code owners should commit to reviewing tickets at least twice a week for approximately one hour. This enables progress and unlocks others.

* **Risk Identification & Management**: Surface and address risks or blockers promptly, working collaboratively to minimize their impact.

* **Problem Solving**: Go beyond the acceptance criteria to understand and effectively address the underlying problem.

## Project Management

### Kanban Project Board

To track our progress and manage issues effectively, we use a [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/NEAR-DevHub/projects/4/views/1). The board consists of the following columns:

1. **Triage**: Issues that need processing, such as adding details, priority, and size.
2. **Backlog**: Issues that are accepted and ready for development.
3. **In Development**: Issues that are in active development.
4. **Blockers**: Issues that are blocked.
5. **In Review**: Issues that are waiting for peer review.
6. **Done**: Items that are shipped to production.
7. **Closed**: Items that we won’t fix or can’t reproduce.

```
Note: To update the status of tickets, you will need project permissions. If you don’t have these permissions, please leave a comment instead (e.g., “Move this ticket to `In Progress`”) and a DevHub Moderator will handle the necessary updates for you.
```

### Triaging

Triaging is the process of reviewing all new issues to ensure they are ready for development. Here's how we do it:   

1. **Validation**: Active DevHub contributors may review new issues in the triage column and determine if they are valid, actionable, and useful. We may update the title or description, verify the reproduction steps, remove duplicates, and apply the appropriate [labels](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-bos/labels), such as the [good first issues](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-bos/contribute) label to issues that are good for new developers.

2. **Prioritization**: DevHub Moderators will work to prioritize issues using these levels:
    * **P0**: Critical issues that need immediate attention.
    * **P1**: High-priority issues to address next.
    * **P2**: Medium-priority issues to address in the coming weeks.
    * **P3**: Low-priority issues to address in the future.

3. **Sizing**: DevHub contributors may estimate the level of effort using t-shirt sizes:
    * **XS**: 1/2 day
    * **S**: 1 day
    * **M**: 3 days
    * **L**: 1 Week
    * **XL**: 2 Weeks
    * **XXL**: 2+ Weeks

Please add questions or comments for any clarifications or design needs to help with estimation.

4. **Milestones**: DevHub Moderators will group several related tickets into themes using [milestones](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-bos/milestones), such as a new feature or improvements to a specific platform area.

5. **Start/End Dates**: Active DevHub contributors may assign estimated dates to help us plan roadmap and potential resource needs for specific deliverables.

Once an item is triaged, we move it to the [Backlog column](https://github.com/orgs/NEAR-DevHub/projects/4/views/1).

## Developer Workflow

Our development workflow guides us through managing issues and pull requests from start to finish. It consists of the following steps:

### 1. **Select Issues**

    1. You can pick any issues from the Backlog column and indicate your interest by leaving a comment. A DevHub Moderator will assign the ticket to you.
    2. If an issue has an estimation or the existing estimation seems off, add your estimation with one or two sentences explaining why you think it will take that amount of time.

Note: We expect you to complete your ticket within the number of days you committed. So if a ticket is ~3 days, you should be able to request a review on the third or fourth day.

### 2. **Start Working** 

    1. Move the issue to “In Progress” and add the start date on our project board once you start working on it.
    2. Reference the issue in the PR description with “_Resolves #XX_”, so it is automatically linked, it is easy to find the prior context and expectations, and the issue will get automatically closed once PR is merged
    3. Use a draft PR to indicate that the work is not ready and you are working on it

Notes: We may reassign issues that are not in progress yet. So it is important to indicate once you start working on it. 

### 3. **Implement tests**

    1. As part of every development work, there should be tests that cover the functionality you have made, or the bug you have fixed
    2. Implement tests to ensure that other developers will be warned if they break your code by accident
    3. Also use tests to speed up your own development workflow. Writing tests during implementation should reduce the code-test iteration loop time.
    4. Help the Pull Request reviewer, your tests should clearly describe what you have implemented. The better the test coverage, the better are the chances of getting your PR approved.
    5. For more information about writing tests look into the contribution guidelines.

[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-bos/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-tests)

### 4. **Update Tickets**

    1. If your ticket blocked:
        1. Identify blocker: Add a comment specifying the blocker, what actions you have already taken to understand and mitigate the problem, and tag the appropriate people and specify what you need. Move the ticket to the blocked column.
        2. Own resolution: Add daily comments to the ticket to communicate the progress. Try to resolve the blocking ticket or find an owner for it. Once the blocker is resolved, add a comment specifying that it is no longer blocker. Move the ticket back to the backlog. 
    2. If your ticket takes longer than your estimation time:
        a. Add a comment specifying why the ticket is larger than your original estimate and what actions have you already taken, and what are your next steps. 
        b. Tag the Tech Lead and propose a new estimate for the amount of time you need to finish the task, along with the rationale for it. Or specify if you need someone else to take over.
        c. Add a daily comment to the ticket to indicate your progress.

[Example 2b](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-bos/pull/126#issuecomment-1554330035)

### 5. **Request Review** 

    1. Deploy a preview version, see how to deploy a preview version below. Once you completed your work, and provide the link in the PR description.
    2. Test the preview version to ensure everything works and meets the acceptance criteria
    3. Change the PR from draft to “ready for review”

### 6. **Review** 

    1. Another team member should review your work within one day. If you do not get a response, escalate on our Telegram channel.
    2. For reviewers: If there are no reviews by the end of your work day, please leave your review. 
    3. We require one code owner review, and in the case the reviewer has questions about the UI/UX, a review from the PM, to approve the pull request.

### 7. **Address Review** 
    1. Address any new review comments within 2 business days
    2. Respond to each comment by either following the suggestion or providing a rationale for disagreement.
    3. Request further review from the same reviewer.

### 8. **Completion**

    1. If the PR is approved, a DevHub Tech Lead squash and merge the PR and the issue is considered done.
    2. Move the issue to the “Done” column in our project board
    3. Add the end date to the issue.

## Communication

We use the following channels for communication:

* **GitHub**: For specific issues and pull requests. Enable [notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) to ensure you get the latest updates.
* **Telegram**: For general questions or concerns.
* **Weekly Standup Calls**: To discuss progress, plans, and blockers.

In case of urgent matters, you may request an ad hoc call.

Thank you for your commitment to the DevHub community! We look forward to collaborating with you.

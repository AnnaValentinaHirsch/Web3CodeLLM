# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at team@mltooling.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to our project. This page will give you a quick overview of how things are organized and, most importantly, how to get involved. Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution.

## Table of contents

1. [Add a project](#add-a-project)
2. [Update a project](#update-a-project)
3. [Improve metadata collection](#improve-metadata-collection)
4. [Improve markdown generation](#improve-markdown-generation)
5. [Create your own best-of list](#improve-markdown-generation)
6. [Code of conduct](#code-of-conduct)

## Add a project

If you like to suggest or add a project, choose one of the following ways:

- Suggest a project by opening an issue: Please use the suggest project template from the [issue page](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto/issues/new/choose) and fill in the requested information.
- Add a project by modifying the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto/blob/main/projects.yaml) and submitting a pull request with your addition. This can also be done directly via the [Github UI](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto/edit/main/projects.yaml).

Before opening an issue or pull request, please ensure that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Please make sure that the project was not already added or suggested to this best-of list. You can ensure this by searching the projects.yaml, the Readme, and the issue list.
- Add the project to the `projects.yaml` and never to the `README.md` file directly. Use the yaml format and the properties documented in the [project properties](#project-properties) section below to add a new project, for example:
    ```yaml
    - name: Tensorflow
      github_id: tensorflow/tensorflow
      pypi_id: tensorflow
      conda_id: tensorflow
      labels: ["tensorflow"]
      category: ml-frameworks
    ```
- Please create an individual issue or pull request for each project.
- Please use the following title format for the issue or pull request: `Add project: project-name`.
- If a project doesn't fit into any of the pre-existing categories, it should go under the `Others` category by not assigning any category. You can also suggest a new category via the add or update category template on the [issue page](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto/issues/new/choose).

## Update a project

If you like to suggest or contribute a project update, choose one of the following ways:

- Suggest a project update by opening an issue: Please use the update project template from the [issue page](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto/issues/new/choose) and fill in the requested information.
- Update a project by modifying the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto/blob/main/projects.yaml) and submitting a pull request with your changes. This can also be done directly via the [Github UI](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto/edit/main/projects.yaml).

Before opening an issue or pull request, please ensure that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Only update the project in the `projects.yaml` and never to the `README.md` file directly. Use the yaml format and the properties documented in the [project properties](#project-properties) section below to update a new project.
- Please create an individual issue or pull request for each project.
- Please use the following title format for the issue or pull request: `Update project: project-name`.

## Improve metadata collection

If you like to contribute to or share suggestions regarding the project metadata collection, please refer to the [best-of-generator](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator) repository.

## Create your own best-of list

If you want to create your own best-of list, we strongly recommend to follow [this guide](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of/blob/main/create-best-of-list.md). With this guide, it will only take about 3 minutes to get you started. It is already set-up to automatically run the best-of generator via our Github Action and includes other useful template files.

## Code of Conduct

All members of the project community must abide by the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.0](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Only by respecting each other we can develop a productive, collaborative community.

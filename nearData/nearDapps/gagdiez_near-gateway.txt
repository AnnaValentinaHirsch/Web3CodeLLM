# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at devconsole-team@pagoda.co. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,
available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html

'''--- CONTRIBUTING.md ---
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Blockchain Operating System reference gateway - Near Discovery.  We welcome contributions from everyone.  Below are various bits of information to help you get started.  If you require additional help, please start a [Discussion](https://github.com/near/near-discovery/discussions).

## Next Steps

To learn more about how `near-discovery` works, checkout the guide to setup local development [here](https://github.com/near/near-discovery/blob/develop/README.md).

If you are looking for relatively simple tasks to familiarise yourself with
`near-discovery`, take a look at the issues labeled `good first issue`
[here](https://github.com/near/near-discovery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).  If you see
one that looks interesting and is unassigned or has not been actively worked on
in some time, please go ahead and start working towards creating your first pull request.

If you have an idea for an enhancement to the Near Discovery, please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/near/near-discovery/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)

## Pull Requests

All the contributions to `near-discovery` happen via Pull Requests.  Please follow the
following steps when creating a PR:

1. Fork the `near-discovery` repository and create a new branch to do you work there.
2. The branch can contain any number of commits.  When merged, all commits will
   be squashed into a single commit.
3. Thoroughly test your changes.
4. When ready, create a pull request against the `develop` branch of `near-discovery`.
5. Feel free to submit draft PRs to get early feedback and to make sure you are
   on the right track.
6. The PR name should follow the template: `<type>: <name>`.  Where `type` is:
   - `fix` for bug fixes;
   - `feat` for new features;
   - `refactor` for changes that reorganize code without adding new content;
   - `doc` for changes that change documentation or comments;
   - `test` for changes that introduce new tests;
   - `chore` for grunt tasks like updating dependencies.
7. The PR should also contain a description when appropriate to provide
   additional information to help the reviewer inspect the proposed change.

## After the PR is submitted

1. When all the comments from the reviewer(s) have been addressed, the reviewer should
approve the PR.
2. An approved PR will be merged automatically into `develop`, which is continuously deployed to [beta.near.org](https://beta.near.org)

## Release Schedule
Changes from `develop` are promoted to the `main` branch weekly, on Thursdays.

# NEAR Discovery (BOS)

## Setup & Development

_This repo requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)._

Initialize repo:

```
pnpm i
```

Start development version:

```
pnpm dev
```

## Local Component Development

1. Run an instance of a component server like [near/bos-loader](https://github.com/near/bos-loader) which serves component code in the following format

   ```json
   {
     "components": {
       "<component path 1>": {
         "code": "<component 1 code>"
       },
       "<component path 2>": {
         "code": "<component 2 code>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   this will be used as a `redirectMap` in `ViewPage`

2. Open the `/flags` route of your viewer and set the BOS Loader URL e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:3030`

Note: there is no hot reload, you must refresh the page to see component changes

## Local VM Development

> This section needs testing since switch to pnpm

If you need to make changes to the VM and test locally, you can easily link your local copy of the VM:

1. Clone the VM repo as a sibling of `near-discovery`:

```
git clone git@github.com:NearSocial/VM.git
```

Folder Structure:

```
/near-discovery
/VM
```

2. Run `pnpm link ../VM`

3. Any time you make changes to the `VM`, run `pnpm build` inside the `VM` project in order for the viewer project to pick up the changes

# Toast

Implemented via Radix primitives: https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/toast

_If the current props and Stitches style overrides aren't enough to cover your use case, feel free to implement your own component using the Radix primitives directly._

## Example

Using the `openToast` API allows you to easily open a toast from any context:

```tsx
import { openToast } from '@/components/lib/Toast';

...

<Button
  onClick={() =>
    openToast({
      type: 'ERROR',
      title: 'Toast Title',
      description: 'This is a great toast description.',
    })
  }
>
  Open a Toast
</Button>
```

You can pass other options too:

```tsx
<Button
  onClick={() =>
    openToast({
      type: 'SUCCESS', // SUCCESS | INFO | ERROR
      title: 'Toast Title',
      description: 'This is a great toast description.',
      icon: 'ph-bold ph-pizza', // https://phosphoricons.com/
      duration: 20000, // milliseconds (pass Infinity to disable auto close)
    })
  }
>
  Open a Toast
</Button>
```

## Deduplicate

If you need to ensure only a single instance of a toast is ever displayed at once, you can deduplicate by passing a unique `id` key. If a toast with the passed `id` is currently open, a new toast will not be opened:

```tsx
<Button
  onClick={() =>
    openToast({
      id: 'my-unique-toast',
      title: 'Toast Title',
      description: 'This is a great toast description.',
    })
  }
>
  Deduplicated Toast
</Button>
```

## Custom Toast

If you need something more custom, you can render a custom toast using `lib/Toast/Toaster.tsx` as an example like so:

```tsx
import * as Toast from '@/components/lib/Toast';

...

<Toast.Provider duration={5000}>
  <Toast.Root open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>
    <Toast.Title>My Title</Toast.Title>
    <Toast.Description>My Description</Toast.Description>
    <Toast.CloseButton />
  </Toast.Root>

  <Toast.Viewport />
</Toast.Provider>
```

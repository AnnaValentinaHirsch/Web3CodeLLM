Three0
==================
Three0 is a completely decentralized BaaS (Backed-As-A-Service) providing easy to use tools to build Web3 dApps through a Web2 lens. Three0 offers 4 main services - Database, Authentication, Storage, and Hosting.

Currently this project contains the Database and Authentication services and will soon be implementing the Storage and Hosting services.

Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] ≥ 12
2. Clone this repository
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the local development server: `npm run dev` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `npm`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet!

Go ahead and play with the app and the code. As you make code changes, the app will automatically reload.

Exploring The Code
==================

This [React] app was initialized with [create-near-app]

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder. `/src/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/src/index.js`, where you
   can learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the smart
   contract. See `contract/README` for info about how it's tested. The frontend
   code gets tested with [jest]. You can run both of these at once with `npm
   run test`.

Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `npm run dev`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.

Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `npm install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `three0.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `three0.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account three0.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'three0.YOUR-NAME.testnet'

Step 3: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    npm run deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this does two things:

1. builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet
2. builds & deploys frontend code to GitHub using [gh-pages]. This will only work if the project already has a repository set up on GitHub. Feel free to modify the `deploy` script in `package.json` to deploy elsewhere.

Troubleshooting
===============
On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.

Additional Notes
================
## NEAR Kurtosis
- To use your own NEAR Kurtosis instance create a `.env` folder in the `.near` directory and set the `KURTOSIS_URL` variable to the URL of your own Kurtosis instance.
- To use the NEAR CLI for the localnet mode (Three0's Kurtosis Instance) set the `NEAR_ENV` environment variable to `localnet` before running any `near` commands. This will ensure that the NEAR CLI uses the localnet node URL and keys.
   - To change back to testnet set the `NEAR_ENV` environment variable to `testnet` before running any `near` commands.
- We at Three0 use our own cloud NEAR Kurtosis instance to develop. If you wish to use the `testnet` to develop change
```
case 'production':
case 'testnet':
   return {
      ...
   }
case 'development':
case 'localnet':
	return {

Three0-Rust Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`. You can compile it with
   the `./compile` script.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.

  [smart contract]: https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview
  [Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
  [create-near-app]: https://github.com/near/create-near-app
  [correct target]: https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs#pre-requisites
  [cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html

'''
'''--- contract/compile.js ---
// This file does two things:
//
// 1. Compile the Rust contract using cargo (see buildCmd below). This will
//    create a wasm file in the 'build' folder.
// 2. Create a symbolic link (symlink) to the generated wasm file in the root
//    project's `out` folder, for easy use with near-cli.
//
// First, import some helper libraries. `shelljs` is included in the
// devDependencies of the root project, which is why it's available here. It
// makes it easy to use *NIX-style scripting (which works on Linux distros,
// macOS, and Unix systems) on Windows as well.
const sh = require('shelljs')

// Figure out which directory the user called this script from, which we'll use
// later to set up the symlink.
const calledFromDir = sh.pwd().toString()

// For the duration of this script, we want to operate from within the
// Rust project's folder. Let's change into that directory.
sh.cd(__dirname)

// You can call this script with `node compile.js` or `node compile.js
// --debug`. Let's set a variable to track whether `--debug` was used.
const debug = process.argv.pop() === '--debug'

// You can call this script with `node compile.js` or `node compile.js --debug`.
// Let's set a variable to track whether `--debug` was used.
// Note: see other flags in ./cargo/config. Unfortunately, you cannot set the
// `--target option` in Cargo.toml.
const buildCmd = `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown ${debug ? '' : '--release'}`;

// Execute the build command, storing exit code for later use
const { code } = sh.exec(buildCmd)

// Assuming this is compiled from the root project directory, link the compiled
// contract to the `out` folder –
// When running commands like `near deploy`, near-cli looks for a contract at
// <CURRENT_DIRECTORY>/out/main.wasm

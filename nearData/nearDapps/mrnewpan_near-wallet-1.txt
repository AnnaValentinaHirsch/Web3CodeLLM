## Problem
What problem are we solving with? Is this epic part of the planned features [here](https://github.com/near/near-wallet-roadmap/projects/1), and which ones?

#### How did we discover this problem?
How did this problem originate? If it was revealed through user feedback, how was that feedback received and from whom?

#### Job Story(s)
- What are the [job stories](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/converting-to-jobs-stories) that frame the users' context, motivations and goals?
- Template: When I [situation], I want to [motivation] so I can [outcome/benefit].

## Scope

#### What are we planning to do about it?
- What is the scope of the design and engineering work required for this project?
Along the way, this epic will be linked with issues and pull requests

#### What are we _not_ planning to do about it?
- What items have been considered but may fall out of the scope of design and engineering work for this project?
Sometimes the scope is too large, and this section may lead other epics, other features [here](https://github.com/near/near-wallet-roadmap/projects/1) or even other products

## Measuring Success
- Are there a set of quantifiable metrics that we can surface once the work has been completed in order to determine how successful our solution was?

## Resources
- Are there any resources that are necessary or that will aid in the completion of this work?

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at social@nearprotocol.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,
available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html

# Contributing to NEAR

NEAR welcomes help in many forms including development, code review, documentation improvements, and outreach.
Please visit [the contribution overview](https://docs.nearprotocol.com/docs/contribution/contribution-overview) for more information.

## Using Github issues and pull requests

Some repositories have specific issue templates that will be helpful for maintainers and community contributors. Please use the templates whenever available.

Please include steps to reproduction, if reporting an error. Information on all applicable versions is quite helpful. Some versions can be found using the command line. (For example: `node --version` or `rustc --version`.) Other version information may be packaged as dependencies. (For example: in `package.json` or `Cargo.toml`.)

If there are verbosity flags available, please include those to offer as much information as possible.

When opening a pull request, please use the typical open-source flow of forking the desired repository and opening a pull request from your forked repository. (More information on [technical contributions here](https://docs.nearprotocol.com/docs/contribution/technical-contribution).)

## Testing

Please note that for technical contributions, NEAR runs a battery of continuous integration tools and tests for each pull request.

It's encouraged to write unit tests on new features. Many NEAR repositories have built-in scripts that run tests locally. Tests may check linting and must be addressed.

For example, a repository might have `yarn test` available. It's a good idea to run tests locally before submitting a pull request, as these will be caught during the CI process.

**Note**: this Wallet repository is one where `yarn test` is available. Before running tests, run `yarn` to ensure all the dependencies are brought in.

### Thank you

NEAR values all contributors to the projects in the ecosystem and invites public discussion on the tech and vision. Please feel free to join the conversation using the links offered at [near.help](https://near.help).

# NEAR Wallet E2E Tests

An end to end test suite for NEAR Wallet flows. Intended to verify and assert that all major flows are functional.

Setup
---

#### To run the test suite
1. Add the following environment variables
    * **`BANK_ACCOUNT`**: This is the account id the test suite will use to generate temporary sub accounts for testing.
    * **`BANK_SEED_PHRASE`**: The seed phrase for the `BANK_ACCOUNT`
    * **`TEST_ACCOUNT_SEED_PHRASE`**: Seed phrase to use for accounts temporarily generated by the test suite. 
    * **`WALLET_NETWORK`**: The wallet network (/mainnet|testnet|betanet/) to run the tests against. defaults to testnet
    * **`NODE_URL`** (optional): The rpc node to use for the test suite's connection to NEAR. defaults to https://rpc.testnet.near.org
    * **`WALLET_URL`** (optional): The wallet URL to use in the test suite. defaults to https://wallet.testnet.near.org
2. Run 
    * `yarn && yarn run e2e` or 
    * `yarn && yarn run e2e:debug` to run in [debug mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#run-in-debug-mode)

Tooling
---
* This module uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to include support for webkit and multi-tab flows
* This module uses the official [Playwright Test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/test) test runner
* This module extends the matchers provided the the test runner and makes assertions using [expect-playwright](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright)

Best Practices and Design Decisions
---
#### [Jest](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright) vs [Playwright Test runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/test)
*    We opted for the official Playwright test runner
*    We prefer a simpler setup with less moving parts and APIs to reason about
*    Support for [testing-library](https://github.com/hoverinc/playwright-testing-library) queries is not crucial to us at the moment since we intend to use **test-id**s frequently in our end to end test suite. More on this below.

#### Test IDs vs User driven selectors and queries
* We will use test-ids frequently in our end to end tests. We will use user centric queries as encouraged by [testing library](https://testing-library.com/) in our unit and integration tests.
* This is because our main goal here is functionality not accessibility or visibility
* Having said that, we will not overuse **test-id**s since we don't want to add too much maintanence overhead

# NEAR Wallet Feature Flags

This package enables the use of feature flags across NEAR Wallet. These feature flags serve as code guards around
functionality being implemented, enabling developers to iterate on more complex features while still being able to
deploy small changes. Feature flags are enabled per environment, allowing finer granularity on how the functionality
is rolled out.

Getting started
===

Modifying feature flags requires the use of the `flag` binary, installed by running:

`yarn binstall`

This creates the `flag` binary under `/usr/local/bin/flag`. Running the binary prompts the user for the intended action,
currently one of:
- Creating a new feature flag and setting the environments in which it should be enabled.
- Modifying an existing feature flag to be enabled or disabled in the desired environments.
- Deleting an existing feature flag.

Running the `flag` binary requires a `features/` directory along the current path, the closest of which will be used
by the binary. `flag` is responsible for both generating and modifying the files in this directory, so it is crucial
that no changes are made to this directory's contents outside the `flag` binary once configured.

Using Feature Flags
===

In order to use this package, a `features/` directory must be created at the appropriate level (e.g. the project root) with
the following files:
- `environments.json`: The valid environments for the application, in the form of `"ENV_NAME": "env_value"`.
- `flags.json`: The set of flags enabled per environment. During initial configuration this should be an empty JSON file.
- `features.js`: Module responsible for initializing and exporting the feature flags for use in the target project.

The `features.js` module is responsible for initializing the proxy object via the `initFeatureFlags` method exported from
this package. This method requires three parameters:
- `currentEnvironment`: The environment against which flags should be validated. The provided value must be a valid value in `environments.json` or an exception will be thrown.
- `environments`: The set of valid environments, specified in `environments.json`. 
- `flagState`: The set of defined feature flags, specified in `flags.json`.

Once configured, the proxy object returned from `initFeatureFlags` is used to check the state of a feature by referring to
the flag name, e.g. `const isFeatureXEnabled = Features.FEATURE_X`. The proxy object will throw an exception if the
flag does not exist.

Examples
===

The following outlines initial example templates for the required files mentioned above. This code is required to correctly
set up the `Features` proxy object for use in a project.

#### features/environments.json
```json
{
  "TESTNET": "testnet",
  "MAINNET": "mainnet"
}
```

#### features/flags.json
```json
{}
```

#### features/features.js
```js
const { initFeatureFlags } = require('@near-wallet/feature-flags');

const Environments = require('./environments.json');
const Flags = require('./environments.json');

const Features = initFeatureFlags({
    currentEnvironment: process.env.NEAR_WALLET_ENV, // this can be any environment-derived value so long as it matches a value from environments.json
    environments: Environments,
    flagState: Flags,
});

module.exports = {
    Features,
};
```

# NEAR Wallet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/near/near-wallet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/near/near-wallet)
[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/near/near-wallet) 

This is in-browser web-based wallet for working with NEAR accounts. This wallet stores account keys in open text using the localStorage on user's machine.

WARNING: This wallet shouldn't be used as the only signer for high-value accounts. Make sure to use hardware wallet when substantial amount of NEAR tokens is involved.

Getting started
===

First ensure there is a value for the `NEAR_WALLET_ENV` environment variable. This can be set in `packages/frontend/.env` prior to bundling.
The set of valid values for `NEAR_WALLET_ENV` are the JSON values defined in [environments.json](../../features/environments.json) (e.g. `NEAR_WALLET_ENV=development`).

To build locally, run the following command in the `/frontend` directory. Substitute `testnet` for the desired environment
as outlined above.

`yarn && NEAR_WALLET_ENV=testnet yarn start` will start a server at https://localhost:1234.

The environment must be set at bundle time rather than run time. If you wish to run the frontend package with a different
environment, please run `yarn prebuild` first.

Netlify
===
To setup Netlify previews, you will need to add the following environment variables to your Netlify Deployment in UI:
```
NEAR_WALLET_ENV=development | testnet | mainnet
SENTRY_ORG="sentry organization name (slug)"
SENTRY_PROJECT="sentry project name"
SENTRY_REPOSITORY="your-org/near-wallet"
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="secret token from sentry"
NETLIFY_USE_YARN="true"
```

Testing
===

To run tests:

`yarn test`

# Two Factor Accounts

## High Level

Every wallet 2FA account has a multisig contract deployed with 3 keys and requires 2 confirmations.

The latest contract is always here:
https://github.com/near/core-contracts/blob/master/multisig/src/lib.rs

The NEAR wallet user will have a private key for 2/3 keys and the NEAR Wallet Contract Helper (CH) has 1 key.

Location of keys:
1. is in localStorage on the device the account / 2FA was set up - you can get the private key if you need to use it in the near CLI
2. is a recovery key that was emailed when the account was created - you can get private key from seed phrase: https://github.com/near/near-seed-phrase
3. is in contract helper can ONLY confirm requests - you cannot use this key

You can also add more keys with method permissions `add_request_and_confirm,confirm` for convenience.

## How to Make a 2FA Request

A 2FA request has a receiver accountId and actions. Some minor adjustments re: actions are needed.

### Example: Transfer
```
const request = {
    receiverId: accountId,
    actions: {
        type: 'Transfer',
        // denominated in NEAR e.g. Big(1).times(10 ** 24).toString()
        // '1000000000000000000000000'
        amount: U128,
    }
}
```
Next, get the request nonce (the ID of the next multisig request) and call the method `add_request_and_confirm` on your account:
```
const requestId = await contract.get_request_nonce()
const contract = new nearApiJs.Contract(account, account.accountId, {
    changeMethods: ['add_request_and_confirm', 'confirm'],
})
await contract.add_request_and_confirm({ request })
```

Finally, **using another key**, call the `confirm` method on your account with the request ID from above:
```
await contract.add_request_and_confirm({ request_id: requestId })
```
Ideally, the key calling confirm is the *"other factor"* device. In the case of the NEAR Wallet, the Contract Helper will be calling confirm on behalf of your account only *after* you verify the correct 6 digit security code.

## Is My Account 2FA Enabled?

You can check on the NEAR Wallet, but if you need to do so programmitcally there are a few ways to do this:

1. Check the code hash of the account state to see if it matches one of:
https://github.com/near/near-wallet/blob/79a350dc134331a17cb4627c5e3a9c5741b6a9cc/src/utils/wallet.js#L43-L52

2. Call `/account/recoveryMethods` on the NEAR Wallet Contract Helper. A 2FA account will have a method beginning with `2fa-` either `2fa-email` or `2fa-phone`

For (2)

POST https://helper.mainnet.near.org/account/recoveryMethods

You need to provide a signature, here's an example from the wallet:
https://github.com/near/near-wallet/blob/79a350dc134331a17cb4627c5e3a9c5741b6a9cc/src/utils/wallet.js#L585-L600

'''--- packages/frontend/docs/FungibleTokenDiscovery.md ---
NEAR Wallet Fungible Token ([NEP-141](https://nomicon.io/Standards/FungibleToken/Core.html)) Discovery and Display
===

NEAR Wallet discovers fungible tokens using a range of indexer queries and displays them using data in the token's metadata per the `ft_metadata` spec ([NEP-148](https://nomicon.io/Standards/FungibleToken/Metadata.html))

## Contents

1. [NEAR Wallet fungible token discovery](#NEAR-Wallet-fungible-token-discovery)
2. [NEAR Wallet fungible token display](#NEAR-Wallet-fungible-token-display)

## NEAR Wallet fungible token discovery
The wallet will consider contracts as fungible tokens if they meet any of the following conditions:

1. Any account makes a call to it with one of the following methods and the `receiver_id` property of the `args` is the user's account ID.
    * `ft_transfer`
    * `ft_transfer_call`
    * `ft_mint`
    
2. The bridge token factory account makes a call to it with the `mint` method with the user's account ID as the `account_id` property of the `args`.
3. The user's account ID calls a method named `storage_deposit` OR any method prefixed with `ft_` on it.

The wallet will then make a view call to `ft_balance_of` on the considered contract and list it as a fungible token if it returns a value that is more than zero.

## NEAR Wallet fungible token display

The wallet will display the token using the following properties returned by the contract's `ft_metaddata`:
* `icon`: An icon will be rendered for the fungible token if a data url is supplied.
* `name`: Displayed as the fungible token's title (e.g. Banana) with a fallback to the `symbol` property.
* `symbol`: Displayed to represent the user's balance (e.g. BANANA).
* `decimals`: Used to show the proper significant digits of a token. This concept is explained well in this [OpenZeppelin post](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc20#a-note-on-decimals).

The wallet will also display the balance returned by `ft_balance_of`:

# Linkdrops

* [Creating a linkdrop](#creating-a-linkdrop)
* [Wallet linkdrop page](#wallet-linkdrop-page)

## What is a linkdrop?

Linkdrops allow you to send funds to anyone via a link. The reciever of a linkdrop can add the funds to their existing account or create a new account to claim the funds.

![image info](./assets/linkdrop-landing.png)

## Creating a linkdrop
1. Generate a `KeyPair`.
2. Call the `send` method of an account that has a [linkdrop contract](https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop) deployed with the `publicKey` and an attached amount of NEAR you want to send*.
3. Use the `secretKey` as the `fundingKey` in the link.

Example:
```js
const fundingContractAccountId = "near";
const linkdropKeyPair = KeyPairEd25519.fromRandom();
await linkdropSenderAccount.functionCall(
            fundingContractAccountId,
            "send",
            { public_key: linkdropKeyPair.publicKey.toString() },
            null,
            new BN(parseNearAmount("2.5"))
        );
console.log(`https://wallet.near.org/${fundingContractAccountId}/${linkdropKeyPair.secretKey}`);
```

In this example, we call `send` on the `near` top-level account. The `near` and `testnet` top-level accounts both have linkdrop contracts and are commonly used for this purpose. The [linkdrop-proxy](https://github.com/near-apps/linkdrop-proxy) contract can be used to deploy a linkdrop contract to any account while still having it create a `near` or `testnet` subaccount (as opposed to only it's own subaccount) and works by proxy calling the `create_account` method.

To be able to create accounts on the wallet from linkdrops, call `send` on either a [near-linkdrop](https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop) contract on `near`/`testnet` top-level account or a [linkdrop-proxy](https://github.com/near-apps/linkdrop-proxy) contract on any account.

*The [near-linkdrop](https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop) contract deducts 1Ⓝ when calling `send` to cover account creation via an access key.

## Wallet linkdrop page

     /linkdrop/{fundingContractAccountId}/{linkdropKeyPairSecretKey}?redirectUrl={redirectUrl}
    
* `fundingContractAccountId`: The contract accountId that was used to send the funds.
* `linkdropKeyPairSecretKey`: The corresponding secret key to the public key sent to the contract.
* `redirectUrl`: The url that wallet will redirect to after funds are successfully claimed to an existing account. The URL is sent the accountId used to claim the funds as a query param.

# Linting and Formatting
For consistency and predictable organization of code, this project uses [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. 

## The Setup
The configuration for Eslint can be found at the root of this project:
- Eslint - `.eslintrc.js`

VSCode is configured to automatically fix fixable linting errors on save. See `.vscode/settings.json`.

Within `package.json`, there scripts that you can run to lint and autofix the entire codebase.

```
"lint": "eslint --ext .js --ext .jsx .",
"fix": "eslint --ext .js --ext .jsx . --fix",
```

##  Git Commit hooks
Git commit hooks are a provision that allows us run custom scripts when specific events occur in the git workflow. [See more here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

For this project, we are using the clientside commit hooks to automatically lint and alphabetize staged files before they get pushed.

## Auto-alphabetization of translation files
This is meant to help ensure consistency and ease of reference within the translation files. For this, we are making use of git hooks via a package called [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/). Husky allows us to configure a defined pre-push command which triggers the `prepush` script within modified packages. The `prepush` script in `packages/frontend/package.json` is configured to run a group of commands that lint and autofix, sort translation files as well as runs our unit tests.

Within `package.json`, the block below defines this.

```
 "scripts": {
     ...,
    "prepush": "concurrently \"yarn run fix\" \"cd src/translations && npx sort-json * --ignore-case true\" \"yarn run test\""
  }
 ```
 
Two main things are ensured through this configuration:
- Staged translation files `src/translations/*.json"` get sorted in alphabetical order automatically using a package called [sort-json](https://github.com/kesla/sort-json)
- Staged `.js` and `.jsx` files get linted for any major linting errors and committing will fail until linting errors are resolved e.g unused vars. We can make the rules as tight or loose as we want through the configuration in `.eslintrc.js`.
- All unit tests must past before a developer can successfully push to remote.

## Proposal: Commit messages
Within `.husky/commit-msg`, there's a script that ensures consistent formatting with commit messages using the `commit-msg` git hook. 

The proposed format is:
```
git commit -m "{commit type goes here}: {commit information}"
```

Example:
```
git commit -m "feat: linting support using eslint"
```

The image below provides more information on the commit types.

'''--- packages/frontend/docs/Login.md ---
Wallet Login
===

To implement authentication using the NEAR Wallet, you will need to follow the instructions provided below.

## Prerequisites
* You should already have `near-api-js` installed.

## Steps
1. [Construct wallet login parameters](#construct-wallet-login-parameters)
2. [Initialize a `WalletConnection` and call `requestSignIn`](#initialize-a-walletconnection-and-call-requestsignin)
3. [Wallet redirect on success on failure](#wallet-redirect-on-success-on-failure)
4. [Retrieving the logged in user](#retrieving-the-logged-in-user)

<br/>

## Construct wallet login parameters
The wallet login API accepts 1 parameter as shown below:

| Command | Type | Required | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| contractIdOrOptions | SignInOptions | `true` |A configuration object for the request as shown below. |

```typescript
   // The configuration for SignInOptions 
    interface SignInOptions {
        // The ID of the smart contract requesting access
        contractId?: string;
        // And array of contract methods (Leave empty for access to all methods)
        methodNames?: string[];
        // NEAR wallet will redirect to this URL on sign in success 
        successUrl?: string;
        // NEAR wallet will redirect to this URL on sign in failure 
        failureUrl?: string;
    }
```

### Note
* If you wish to request full access to the wallet, do not pass a `contractId` field to signup options.

<br/>

## Initialize a `WalletConnection` and call `requestSignIn`

Setup a `WalletConnection` instance by passing in your `Near` instance. You can then call the `requestSignIn` method on the `WalletConnection` instance to redirect the user to the wallet for approval. 

```typescript

    const nearAPI = require("near-api-js");
    const { connect, WalletConnection } = nearApi;
    const near = await connect(config);
    const wallet = new WalletConnection(near);

    const contractId = 'example.testnet';
    const successUrl = 'https://demodapp.com/auth/success';
    const failureUrl = 'https://demodapp.com/auth/failure';

    wallet.requestSignIn({ contractId, successUrl, failureUrl });

```

<br/>

## Wallet redirect on success on failure
Once sign in is successfully initiated, the user will be taken to the wallet where they will be presented with a screen to grant access to the contract (see image below).

<img src="./assets/login-request.png" width="500">

<br/>

Once the user allows or denies the request, they will be redirected to the `successUrl` and `failureUrl`  respectively,with the following parameters:

* `account_id` - The ID of the authenticated wallet.
* `all_keys` - A comma separated, concatenated string of available keys on the wallet. 
* `public_key` -  The public key supplied. 

<br/>

## Retrieving the logged in user
Once a user is logged in, you can retrieve the account ID of the authorized wallet using the `getAccountId` method as shown below.

```typescript

    const nearAPI = require("near-api-js");
    const { connect, WalletConnection } = nearApi;
    const near = await connect(config);
    const wallet = new WalletConnection(near);

    const signedInWalletId = wallet.getAccountId();

```

<br/>

## Wallet URL API

The `/login` path of the wallet recognizes the following url parameters:

| Param | Description
| --- | --- |
| `contract_id` | The account ID of the contract to be accessed with the key |
| `public_key` | The corresponding public key to the private key that will be granted access |
| `failure_url` | The url to redirect to if the request is denied |
| `success_url` | The url to redirect to if the request is successful |
| `methodNames` | The `methodNames` that will be accessible with the key  |

When requesting an access key (full or function call), a key pair is generated and the public key is sent to the wallet under the `public_key` parameter along with other information about the request.

### Requesting a function call access key

To request a function call access key, the `contract_id` parameter is set to the target contract account ID and the `methodNames` parameter is set to any methods on the contract the access key should be limited to. If left blank the access key will be able to call all methods on the contract.

Multiple `methodNames` params are added when the key needs to scoped to more than one method.

```
GET https://wallet.testnet.near.org/login?public_key=ed25519%3A4Y1rQKB8STnPBWVo29mRc3Z5ByJwg1FLmX6EMzisVAa4&contract_id=v2.test-contract.testnet?methodNames=method1&methodNames=method2
```

### Requesting a full access key

To request a full access key, omit the `contract_id` or use the target approving user's account ID as `contract_id`.

```
GET https://wallet.testnet.near.org/login?public_key=ed25519%3A4Y1rQKB8STnPBWVo29mRc3Z5ByJwg1FLmX6EMzisVAa4
```

The wallet will then redirect to either `success_url` or `failure_url` (see [wallet redirect](#wallet-redirect-on-success-on-failure)) and transactions can be signed using the private key of the key pair on behalf of the user.

'''--- packages/frontend/docs/NonFungibleTokenDiscovery.md ---
NEAR Wallet Non-Fungible Token ([NEP-171](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Core.html)) Discovery and Display
===

NEAR Wallet discovers non-fungible tokens using a range of indexer queries and displays them using data in the token's metadata per the Non-Fungible Token Metadata spec ([NEP-177](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Metadata.html))

## Contents

1. [NEAR Wallet non-fungible token discovery](#NEAR-Wallet-non-fungible-token-discovery)
2. [NEAR Wallet non-fungible token display](#NEAR-Wallet-non-fungible-token-display)

## NEAR Wallet non-fungible token discovery
The wallet will consider contracts as non-fungible token contracts relevant to the user if they meet any of the following conditions:

1. Any account makes a call to the contract with any method prefixed with `nft_` and the `receiver_id` property of the `args` is the user's account ID.

2. The contract emits a [Non-Fungible Token Event](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Event.html#interface) with `NftMintLog` or `NftTransferLog` data and the `owner_id` or `new_owner_id` value is the user's account ID.

NEAR Wallet then makes a call to `nft_metadata` to fetch the NFT contract's [metadata](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Metadata.html) as `NFTContractMetadata` and then calls `nft_tokens_for_owner` with the `accountId` arg set to the user's account ID to retrieve the tokens owned by the user per the [NFT enumeration spec (NEP-181)](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Enumeration.html). This will include the [`TokenMetadata`](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Metadata.html#interface) used to display the tokens.

## NEAR Wallet non-fungible token display
The NFT is then displayed as follows:

<img src="./assets/non-fungible-token-display.png" height="400">

1. This is the icon for the NFT contract. It's retrieved from the `icon` prop of `NFTContractMetadata` and is rendered if it's a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).
2. This is the `name` prop of the `NFTContractMetadata`. It will link to the NFT contract's account page on [explorer](https://explorer.near.org/).
3. This is the length of the list of tokens returned by the NFT contract's `nft_tokens_for_owner`.
4. This is the image of the token. It's displayed as the `media` prop of [`TokenMetadata`](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Metadata.html#interface) if it's a url or a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs). Otherwise the `media` prop is appended to the `base_uri` prop of `NFTContractMetadata` (fetched from `nft_metadata`) and if `base_uri` is not set, then to `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/` and that is used as the url.
5. This is the `title` prop of [`TokenMetadata`](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Metadata.html#interface)

'''--- packages/frontend/docs/SignTransaction.md ---
Signing transactions
===

Signing a transaction or series of transactions on NEAR Wallet involves constructing the transaction and then using `near-api-js` to redirect the user to the wallet. Once the user approves (or denies) the transaction, they will be redirected to the original url or a pre-specified url. 

## Steps

1. [Construct a transaction](#Construct-a-transaction)
2. [Setup `WalletConnection` and call `requestSignTransactions`](#Setup-WalletConnection-and-callrequestSignTransactions)
3. [Wallet redirect and callback](#Wallet-redirect-and-callback)

## Construct a transaction
At a high level, constructing a transaction is done by calling `createTransaction` from `near-api-js`:

```javascript=
const nearAPI = require("near-api-js");

const transaction = nearAPI.transactions.createTransaction(
  sender,
  publicKey,
  receiver,
  nonce,
  actions,
  recentBlockHash
);
```

More information on each argument can be found [here](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/create-transactions#transaction-requirements).

## Setup `WalletConnection` and call`requestSignTransactions`

Setup a `WalletConnection` instance by passing in your `Near` instance. You can then call `requestSignTransactions` on the `WalletConnection` instance:

```javascript=
const nearAPI = require("near-api-js");
const { connect, WalletConnection } = nearApi;

const near = await connect(config);

const walletConnection = new WalletConnection(near);

// redirect to wallet to sign the transaction
walletConnection.requestSignTransactions({
    transactions: [transaction],
});
```
More information on setting up a connection to NEAR [here](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/create-transactions#setting-up-a-connection-to-near).

`requestSignTransactions` takes in an `options` argument of type `RequestSignTransactionsOptions`:

```typescript=
RequestSignTransactionsOptions {
    /** list of transactions to sign */
    transactions: Transaction[];
    /** url NEAR Wallet will redirect to after transaction signing is complete */
    callbackUrl?: string;
    /** meta information NEAR Wallet will send back to the application. `meta` will be attached to the `callbackUrl` as a url search param */
    meta?: string;
}
```

* The `transactions` property is required and it's a list of transactions that can be created using the method [above](#Construct-a-transaction).
* `callbackUrl` is optional and will default to the current url `window.location.href` when not provided.
* `meta` is optional and can include any information that we'd like forwarded to the `callbackUrl` by the wallet as the `meta` search param.

## Wallet URL API

The `/sign` path of the wallet recognizes the following url parameters:

| Param          | Description                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactions` | A comma seperated list of transactions serialized in [borsh](https://borsh.io/) and then encoded in base64       |
| `callbackUrl`  | The url to [redirect to](#Wallet-redirect-and-callback) after the flow is completed with success or error params |
| `meta`         | Any data the integrator wants passed to the `callbackUrl`                                                        |

### Serializing transactions in [borsh](https://borsh.io/)
A transaction is serialized using [borsh](https://borsh.io/) as follows:

```javascript=
const { transactions } = require("near-api-js");
const borsh = require("borsh");

const tx = {
  "signerId": "sender.near",
  "publicKey": {
    "keyType": 0,
    "data": {
      "0": 199,
      "1": 84,
      // ...
    }
  },
  "nonce": 123456,
  "receiverId": "receiver.near",
  "actions": [
    {
      "createAccount": {},
      "enum": "createAccount"
    },
    {
      "transfer": {
        "deposit": "1000000000000000000000000"
      },
      "enum": "transfer"
    }
  ],
  "blockHash": {
    "type": "Buffer",
    "data": [
      30,
      179,
     // ...
    ]
  }
}

const serializedTx = borsh.serialize(transactions.SCHEMA, tx); // -> Buffer <0B, 00, 00, 00, 73, 65, 6E, 64, 65, 72, 2E, 6E, 65, 61, 72, 00, 25, 62, 11, 78, BC, E5, 68, B9, 9C, 2E, 7A, …>
// borsh.serialize is also re-exported by near-api-js as utils.serialize.serialize
```

The transactions then need to be outputted as `base64` to be passed to the wallet:

```javascript=
const serializedEncodedTx = serializedTx.toString('base64'); // -> "CwAAAHNlbmRlci5uZWFyAGT3V2lh0VAA/mrod+KWM30Iae3jRgA4Uum87Q4YvR6WQOIBAAAAAAANAAAAcmVjZWl2ZXIubmVhch6z3oIrhTeXGliWsOilax3Aoq0rrwkYdb8fNSw75IW3AgAAAAADAAAAoe3MzhvC0wAAAAAAAA=="
```

The resulting string can then be added to the url as a param with `encodeURIComponent`.

### Example usage of wallet URL API

```
GET https://wallet.near.org/sign?transactions=CwAAAHNlbmRlci5uZWFyAGT3V2lh0VAA%2Fmrod%2BKWM30Iae3jRgA4Uum87Q4YvR6WQOIBAAAAAAANAAAAcmVjZWl2ZXIubmVhch6z3oIrhTeXGliWsOilax3Aoq0rrwkYdb8fNSw75IW3AgAAAAADAAAAoe3MzhvC0wAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&callbackUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&meta=test
```

### Wallet transaction sending behavior

For each transaction in the batch, the wallet will create a new transaction based on the `receiverId` and the `actions` that are sent in and sign and send them using the account that the user selects as the `signerId` and signer of the transaction. The account that will be signing and sending the transaction once approved will always be displayed in the **From** section.

## Wallet redirect and callback
The user will be presented with a request to sign the transaction(s) that were passed in in the wallet UI: 

<img src="./assets/sign-transaction-request.png" width="500">

Once the user allows or denies the transaction, they will be redirected to `callbackUrl` with the following parameters:

* `transactionHashes`: a comma seperated string of the transaction hashes of the approved transactions if successful.
* `meta`: the meta search param that was passed by the original URL.
* `errorCode`: The eror code (if any) encountered when signing the transaction.
* `errorMessage`: The error message for the error encountered when signing.

## Disable 2fa

This script allows the user to disable NEAR Wallet 2fa using the provided seedphrase. It converts 2fa LAKs back to FAKs, deploys the empty contract and optionally cleans up state
* arguments: `accountId` `seedPhrase`
* options: `cleanupState` `helperUrl`

### Usage

```shell=
NEAR_WALLET_ENV=mainnet node index.js disable-2fa --accountId="testAccount.near" --seedPhrase='lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit nunc efficitur est'
```
---
## Restore account contract

This script restores account code back to a given `blockHash` by deploying a contract. It pulls contract code from the given archival node
* arguments: `accountId` `seedPhrase` `nodeUrl` `blockHash`

### Usage

```shell=
NEAR_WALLET_ENV=testnet node index.js restore-account-contract --accountId='testAccount.testnet' --seedPhrase='lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit nunc efficitur est' --blockHash='9c5tk9kdTzgAgejgmnLCRu9yJ1Jp1LjFqtgB4SHEzzeB' --nodeUrl='https://sample-archival-testnet-node-url.com/'

With our no-code automated smart contract launchpad and user friendly interface, Loozr empowers users to Trade2Earn, Listen2Earn, Hodl2Earn and Budl2Earn.

#### Loozr actualizes these dreams through her 5 Flagship Products: 
 
1. Music token launchpad: Artists launch tradable profiles and song tokens, fans Invest2Earn, and trade.
 
2. Streaming: Streaming revenue split among token holders (artists and fans).
 
3. Music NFT marketplace: Interoperability for Music NFTs
 
4. SocialFi ($MOMENT): Similar to TikTok, artists and fans can share video moments of LIVE events, recording sessions, tours, skits, covers, EPs, etc… and every $MOMENT can be bought and sold on Loozr as digital assets.
 
5. LOOZRverse:  First-ever immersive location-based music AR/VR Metaverse. Watch the LOOZRverse demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO5-Nx-EENc&t=23s 

🔸 The LZR coin is the platform's native currency that powers the entire ecosystem. Which can be used to purchase launched tokens ($ARTIST & $MUSIC), liquidate those tokens, stream music, hodl and trade on the Loozr platform.
Loozr is the first social music streaming platform built on the blockchain where fans, artists and other music stakeholders succeed in a manner that isn’t detrimental to one another.

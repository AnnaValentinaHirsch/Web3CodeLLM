Vi storage
==================

PriStorage is an application for users who want to store their files in private, which demands a simple application for users to encrypt and manage files stored on Ipfs or Filecoin network using Web3Storage service.This application uses Web3 Storage service for storing file and Near smart contract to manage these files.

Requirement
===========
To use this application, you need to:
1. Create a near wallet account
2. Sign up Web3.Storage service

Quick Start
===========
1. ### Sign up
    Go to [https://pristorage.surge.sh/](https://pristorage.surge.sh/) and click to the login button
    The app will redirect to Near wallet [https://wallet.testnet.near.org/](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) and then allow the app to access wallet (cause this app is now under development so we have just deploy on testnet).
    Go to [https://web3.storage/](https://web3.storage/) and login with your account and copy your Web3.Storage token.
    Comeback the page and paste copied token into the form, wait for the SeedPhrase file is downloaded (this file named as {your_near_wallet_account_id}_SeedPhrase.txt), you are now logged in.
    Make sure you store the SeedPhrase file carefully because it would be used to login your account and used to generate your rsa key pair.

2. ### Sign in
    Go to [https://pristorage.surge.sh/](https://pristorage.surge.sh/), if you have not logged in on this browser, you have to provide the SeedPhrase store in the SeedPhrase file downloaded when you signed up with.
    If the SeedPhrase is correct, you are now logged in.

3. ### Create folder in "My Folders" tab
    Click on "Create folder" button and enter the folder name you, then click "Ok", This app will call a function which stores a json document on the near network for managing the folder.
    The app will redirect to the Near wallet.
    Click on "Allow" button, if the transaction is successful, your folder is created.
    You can go to a folder and create a subfolder in this way too.

4. ### Create folder in "Shared Folders" tab
    Click on "Create folder" button and enter the folder name you, then click "Ok", This app will call a function which stores a json document (which has an attribute is folder_password - encrypted by the key pair and use to encrypt all the files in this folder or its subfolder) on the near network for managing the folder.
    The app will redirect to the Near wallet.
    Click on "Allow" button, if the transaction is successful, your folder is created.
    You can go to a folder and create a subfolder in this way too.

5. ### Upload a file in "My Folders" tab
    You need to make sure that you are accessing a folder to show the "Upload file" button.
    Click on "Upload file" and click or drop you file into the dropzone. This app will create a password randomly, then the file will be encrypted by the password and the password will be encrypted by the key pair. After the process, this app will call a function which stores file on IPFS/Filecoin and stores a json document on the near network for managing the file.
    The app will redirect to the Near wallet.
    Click on "Allow" button, if the transaction is successful, your file is uploaded.

5. ### Upload a file in "Shared Folders" tab
    You need to make sure that you are accessing a folder to show the "Upload file" button.
    Click on "Upload file" and click or drop you file into the dropzone. This app find the root folder of the file (the root folder contain the file) and get its folder_password, then the file will be encrypted by the folder_password. After the process, this app will call a function which stores file on IPFS/Filecoin and stores a json document on the near network for managing the file.
    The app will redirect to the Near wallet.
    Click on "Allow" button, if the transaction is successful, your file is uploaded.

6. ### Share a file or folder in "My folders" tab and "Shared folders"
    Click on the share button of file/folder, then enter the account id of the user you wanna to share it with.
    Allow the transaction on near wallet (like the previous section), if the transaction is successful, the file/folder will render in the tab "Files Shared With Me" (if you shared file) or "Folders Shared With Me" (if you shared file).
    Note: In the "My Folders" tab, you only share a single file, on the other hand, the "Shared Folders" tab allow you to share whole shared folder (the folder in root directory) but you cannot share the subfolder or the file in the shared folder.

7. ### Download file
    Click on the download button of file and wait for app decrypt the file and download it if the encrypt process is successful.

8. ### Delete file/folder
    Click on the delete button of file/folder and allow the incoming transaction, if the transaction is successful, your file/folder is deleted.
    Note: the file is note completely remove on Web3.Storage server the because the Web3.Storage did not provide an api for delete file, we just remove documents contain file's information

9. ### Get shared file/folder with your own
    Go to the tab "Files shared with me" to get the single files shared from other users shared to you
    Go to the tab "Folders shared with me" to get the single files shared from other users shared to you

PriStorage
==================

This [React] app was initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] ≥ 12
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Run the local development server: `yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet!

Go ahead and play with the app and the code. As you make code changes, the app will automatically reload.

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder. `/src/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/src/index.js`, where you
   can learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the smart
   contract. See `contract/README` for info about how it's tested. The frontend
   code gets tested with [jest]. You can run both of these at once with `yarn
   run test`.

Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.

Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    yarn install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `Vi storage 2.0.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `Vi storage 2.0.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account Vi storage 2.0.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'Vi storage 2.0.YOUR-NAME.testnet'

Step 3: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this does two things:

1. builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet
2. builds & deploys frontend code to GitHub using [gh-pages]. This will only work if the project already has a repository set up on GitHub. Feel free to modify the `deploy` script in `package.json` to deploy elsewhere.

Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.

Vi storage 2.0 Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`. You can compile it with
   the `./compile` script.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.

  [smart contract]: https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview
  [Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
  [create-near-app]: https://github.com/near/create-near-app
  [correct target]: https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs#pre-requisites
  [cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html

'''
'''--- contract/compile.js ---
// This file does two things:
//
// 1. Compile the Rust contract using cargo (see buildCmd below). This will
//    create a wasm file in the 'build' folder.
// 2. Create a symbolic link (symlink) to the generated wasm file in the root
//    project's `out` folder, for easy use with near-cli.
//
// First, import some helper libraries. `shelljs` is included in the
// devDependencies of the root project, which is why it's available here. It
// makes it easy to use *NIX-style scripting (which works on Linux distros,
// macOS, and Unix systems) on Windows as well.
const sh = require('shelljs')

// Figure out which directory the user called this script from, which we'll use
// later to set up the symlink.
const calledFromDir = sh.pwd().toString()

// For the duration of this script, we want to operate from within the
// Rust project's folder. Let's change into that directory.
sh.cd(__dirname)

// You can call this script with `node compile.js` or `node compile.js
// --debug`. Let's set a variable to track whether `--debug` was used.
const debug = process.argv.pop() === '--debug'

// You can call this script with `node compile.js` or `node compile.js --debug`.
// Let's set a variable to track whether `--debug` was used.
// Note: see other flags in ./cargo/config. Unfortunately, you cannot set the
// `--target option` in Cargo.toml.
const buildCmd = debug
  ? 'cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown'
  : 'cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release'

// Execute the build command, storing exit code for later use
const { code } = sh.exec(buildCmd)

// Assuming this is compiled from the root project directory, link the compiled
// contract to the `out` folder –
// When running commands like `near deploy`, near-cli looks for a contract at
// <CURRENT_DIRECTORY>/out/main.wasm
if (code === 0 && calledFromDir !== __dirname) {
  const linkDir = `${calledFromDir}/out`
  const link = `${calledFromDir}/out/main.wasm`
  const packageName = require('fs').readFileSync(`${__dirname}/Cargo.toml`).toString().match(/name = "([^"]+)"/)[1]
  const outFile = `./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/${debug ? 'debug' : 'release'}/${packageName}.wasm`
  sh.mkdir('-p', linkDir)
  sh.rm('-f', link)
  //fixes #831: copy-update instead of linking .- sometimes sh.ln does not work on Windows
  sh.cp('-u',outFile,link)
}

// exit script with the same code as the build command
process.exit(code)

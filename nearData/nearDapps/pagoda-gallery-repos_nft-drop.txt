## About

This project is created for easy-to-start as a React + IPFS skeleton template in the Pagoda Gallery. It was initialized with [create-near-app]. Clone it and start to build your own gallery project!

### Built With

[create-near-app], [amazing-github-template](https://github.com/dec0dOS/amazing-github-template)

Getting Started
==================

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed – we are targeting versions `16+`.

Read about other [prerequisites](https://docs.near.org/develop/prerequisites) in our docs.

Optionally create an account on [web3.storage](https://web3.storage) in order to upload files directly to IPFS from the frontend.

Generate an API token on web3.storage by following [this guide](https://web3.storage/docs/how-tos/generate-api-token/) and, finally, store the token in your `frontend/.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_AUTH_TOKEN`. Note this means the API token will be available to anyone who has access to your website. This might not be ideal for a production application but works great for prototyping.

### Installation

Install all dependencies:

    npm install

Deploy your NFT contracts to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy

Initialize the NFT contract (customize this to your needs):

    near call <neardev-account> new '{"owner_id":"<YOUR_ACCOUNT>","metadata": {"spec":"nft-1.0.99","name":"<YOUR_NFT_NAME>","symbol":"<YOUR_UNIQUE_SYMBOL>","base_uri":"https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/"}}' --accountId <YOUR_ACCOUNT>

You also need to add keypom as an approved minter to mint NFTs on your behalf, add approved minters to NFT series contract:
    
    near call <neardev-account> add_approved_minter '{"account_id":"beta.keypom.testnet"}' --accountId <YOUR_ACCOUNT>

By default, only the owner will be able to create NFT series on this contract. You can optionally add anyone else as an approved creator by running:

    near call <neardev-account> add_approved_creator '{"account_id":"<APPROVED_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <YOUR_ACCOUNT>

Usage
=====

Start your frontend in development mode:

    npm run dev

Start your frontend in production mode:

    npm run start

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The pre-built smart-contract code lives in the `/contracts` folder. This app is built from [Keypom's NFT tutorial series app](https://github.com/keypom/nft-tutorial-series). In blockchain apps the smart contract is the "backend" of your app.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/pages/index.tsx` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it uses `/frontend/contracts/keypom-contract.ts`,
   this is your entrypoint to learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.

Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts].
When you run `npm run deploy`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a temporary dev account.
When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how:

Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `npm install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: deploy the contract
---------------------------

Use the CLI to deploy the contract to TestNet with your account ID.

    near deploy --accountId near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --wasmFile ./contracts/nft-series/nft-series.wasm

Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer using any of the [private contact addresses](https://github.com/near/boilerplate-template#support). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

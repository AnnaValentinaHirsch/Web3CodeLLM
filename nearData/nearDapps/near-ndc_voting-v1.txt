# NDC v1 Smart Contracts

In NDC v1, there will be only two mechanisms to vote: simple proposal voting and elections. Both are based on stake weight.

- Details about the Framework: [near-ndc/gov](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov).

This repository provides smart contracts for NDC v1 Voting Body.

## Proposal types

| Proposal                                     | Voting Entity | Contract    |
| :------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| Elect house representatives                  | Voting Body   | elections   |
| Constitution ratification                    | Voting Body   | voting body |
| Dissolve a house and call for new elections  | Voting Body   | voting body |
| Setup Package                                | Voting Body   | voting body |
| Budget ratification                          | Voting Body   | voting body |
| Veto HoM Recurrent and Big Funding Proposals | Voting Body   | voting body |
| Budget                                       | HoM           | congress    |
| Transfer Funds                               | HoM           | congress    |
| Funding proposal                             | HoM           | congress    |
| Veto any HoM proposal                        | CoA           | congress    |
| Reinstate representative                     | TC / CoA      | congress    |
| Investigate                                  | TC            | congress    |
| Remove representative                        | TC            | congress    |

In NDC v1, Voting Body can't make proposal for budget management. They can only veto budget proposals.

### General voting rules

- user can only vote for active proposals
- user can not overwrite his vote

### Elections

Elections for NDC v1 Houses.

👉 [**Voting Process**](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md)

### Voting Body

Voting Body is set of human verified NEAR accounts constituting NDC.

Voting mechanisms as well as Powers, Checks and Balances of the Voting Body is described in the [NDC Gov v1 Framework](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/gov-framework.md).

- Propose and approve HoM **setup package**: a request to deploy funds from the [Community Treasury](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/community-treasury.md) to HoM DAO.
- **Voting Body Veto** is a special proposal to veto other proposal made by a house. When a HoM or CoA proposal will pass it must not be executed immediately. There must be an challenge period, where a Voting Body or the TC can stop the proposal execution by successfully submitting a Veto proposal.

# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

### Features

### Bug Fixes

## v1.2.0 (2023-12-28)

### Features

- `all_hook_permissions` query to return all hook permissions.

### Improvements

- Remove temporal `add_tc_dismiss_perm` and gas adjustments in the `execute` method related to the wrong Gas settings in the TC proposals (and missing checks mentioned in the v1.1.2 release).

## v1.1.2 (2023-12-28)

### Improvements

- `create_proposal` has additional checks for the function call actions. We observed that too much gas was set in the actions, prohibiting correct contract execution (not enough gas to do self execution).
- Temporal gas adjustment to allow TC execution of dismiss proposals (related to the point above).

### Bug Fixes

- Added Dismiss hook permission to dismiss members of TC by TC (`congress-tc-v1.ndc-gwg.near`).

## v1.1.1 (2023-12-16)

### Features

- Added `add_fun_call_perm` call, that can only be run by the contract authority.

### Bug Fixes

- Updating Transparency Commission mainnet instance to add `FunctionCall` permission.

## v1.1.0 (2023-11-20)

### Features

- `members_len` view method.

### Breaking changes

- added `members_len` field to smart contract.
- renamed `voting_duration` and `min_voting_duration` to `vote_duration` and `min_vote_duration` in the Config and initialization (`new`). Motivation is to make it consistent with the Voting Body Config.

## v1.0.0 (2023-11-01)

### Features

- Store vote timestamps.
- Added `min_voting_duration`. With non zero `min_voting_duration`, a proposal is in progress until:
  - all votes were cast
  - OR voting_duration passed
  - OR `min_voting_duration` passed and the tally can be finalized (proposal reached min amount of approval votes or have enough abstain + reject votes to block the approval).
- Extended `ConfigOutput` to include all contract parameters.

### Breaking changes

- `proposal.votes` map type has changed. The values are `VoteRecord` (vote and the timestamp) instead of `Vote`.
- `execute` method return type changed: from `Result<PromiseOrValue<()>, ExecError>` to `Result<PromiseOrValue<Result<(), ExecRespErr>>, ExecError>`. Note the inner result. If the result is `Ok(PromiseOrValue::Value(Err(..)))` then the transaction will pass (state change will be properly recorded), but the proposal fails to execute due to error reported through `ExecRespError`.

### Bug Fixes

- Proposal status calculation in when querying proposals.
- Proposal: handle budget overflow, when there are two competing proposals.

## v0.2.0 (2023-10-24)

### Features

- Added abstain vote type.
- new `is_member(&self, account: AccountId) -> bool` query function.

### Bug Fixes

- Proposal iterator to handle edge case for the limit parameter.

## v0.1.0 (2023-10-13)

## Creating a Proposal

Each Congress house specifies which proposal kinds are allowed to be created. It is a subset of:

- `FunctionCall`: if approved, proposal execution will create a cross contract call.
- `Text`: text based proposal, no automated action is performed.
- `FundingRequest(Balance)`: request to fund a specific project. Balance is the amount of Near provided as funding. If Balance is bigger or equal than `big_funding_threshold` then it is eligible for `VetoBigOrReccurentFundingReq`. Proposal execution will fail if the total budget spend (including the one from the proposal) goes above the `contract.budget_cap`.
  NOTE: The contract doesn't track the monthly budget limit. That should be tracked off-chain.
- `RecurrentFundingRequest(Balance)`: funding request that will renew every month until the end of the terms. The balance parameter is the size of the single month spending for this funding request. The proposal is eligible for
  `VetoBigOrReccurentFundingReq`. Proposal execution will fail if the total budget spend (including the one from the proposal multiplied by the amount of remaining months) goes above the `contract.budget_cap`.
- `DismissAndBan(member, house)`: requests I Am Human registry to ban the member account (set `GovBan` flag in the IAH registry) and calls the dismiss hook on the house.

Each proposal comes with a description, which should provide motivation and a background.

### Cheat sheet

Below we present how to make a proposal for every possible Congress motion:

#### Veto

Veto is created by a separate account or DAO that has a permission to call the `veto_hook`. `VetoAll` permission allows to veto any proposal, while `VetoBigOrReccurentFundingReq` only allows to veto recurrent funding proposals or funding proposals above `big_funding_threshold`.
In NDC Gov v1 the following entities have permission to veto HoM proposals:

- `voting-body-v1.ndc-gwg.near`: `VetoBigOrReccurentFundingReq`
- `congress-coa-v1.ndc-gwg.near`: `VetoAl`

To create a veto within the congress houses, use the `create_proposal` function:

```json
near call congress-coa-v1.ndc-gwg.near create proposal '{
  "kind": {
    "FunctionCall": {
      "receiver_id": "congress-hom-v1.ndc-gwg.near",
      "actions": [
        {
          "method_name": "veto_hook",
          "args": {"id": "proposal_id to be vetoed"},
          "deposit": "100000000000000000000000",
          "gas": "300000000000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "description": "Your description"
}' --accountId your_account.near
```

See also the `Voting Body` documentation.

#### Dismiss

To initiate a dismiss, the executing house must have `Dismiss` permission. In NDC Gov v1, the authority to dismiss any member of the `HoM` and `CoA` rests with the `TC` (Transparency Commision).

To propose a dismiss proposal, call the `create_proposal` function:

```json
near call congress-coa-v1.ndc-gwg.near create proposal '{
  "kind": {
    "FunctionCall": {
      "receiver_id": "congress-hom-v1.ndc-gwg.near",
      "actions": [
        {
          "method_name": "dismiss_hook",
          "args": {"member": "member_to_dismiss.near"},
          "deposit": "100000000000000000000000",
          "gas": "300000000000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "description": "Your description"
}' --accountId your_account.near
```

#### Dismiss and Ban

To initiate a dismiss and ban action, the executing house must have `DismissAndBan` permission. In NDC Gov v1, the authority to dismiss any member of the `HoM` and `CoA` rests with the `TC` (Transparency Commision).

To propose a dismiss and ban proposal, call the `create_proposal` function:

```json
near call congress-tc-v1.ndc-gwg.near create proposal '{
  "kind": {
    "DismissAndBan": {
      "member": "member_to_dismiss_and_ban.near",
      "house": "congress-hom-v1.ndc-gwg.near",
    },
  },
  "description": "Your description"
}' --accountId your_account.near
```

## Proposal Lifecycle

When a proposal is created it will have `InProgress` status and the `submission_time` will be set.

```mermaid
---
title: Possible Proposal Status Flows
---
flowchart TB
    Create_Proposal --> InProgress
    InProgress --> Approved
    InProgress --> Rejected
    InProgress --> Vetoed
    Approved --> Executed
    Approved --> Failed
    Approved --> Vetoed
    Failed -- re-execute --> Executed
```

### Voting

Any member can vote for any `InProgress` proposal. Members can't overwrite their votes. Proposal is in progress until:

- all votes were cast
- OR `vote_duration` passed
- OR `min_vote_duration` passed and the tally can be finalized (proposal reached min amount of approval votes or have enough abstain + reject votes to block the approval).

Example CLI command to vote for a proposal:

``` shell
# vote must be one of: "Approve", "Reject", "Abstain"
near call HOUSE vote '{"id": PROP_ID, "vote": "Approve"}' --accountId YOU
```

### Vetoing

Any proposal can be vetoed (even an in progress one) until the cooldown is over.
A DAO `A` can veto a proposal `P` of house `H` if:

- `P` cooldown is not over (is in progress, approved or rejected).
- `H` gives veto permission to `A`: `contract.hook_auth[A]` contains `VetoAll` or `VetoBigOrReccurentFundingReq`. The latter will only allow `A` to veto big funding proposals or recurrent funding proposals.

### Execution

Anyone (not only a house member) can execute a proposal when a proposal that is:

- min vote duration passed;
- cooldown is over;
- proposal is _approved_ or _failed_.

A proposal is **approved** when:

- is not in progress;
- AND got enough #approved votes (`>= contract.threshold`).

Proposal reaches _failed_ status when it was approved, but the execution failed. In that can be re-executed again.

If proposal execution breaks an invariant check (eg: crossing the budget cap), then the transaction will succeed and a composed error will be returned: the `Ok(Err(ExecRespErr::**))` of `Result<PromiseOrValue<Result<(), ExecRespErr>>, ExecError>` type.

Example CLI command to execute a proposal:

``` shell
near call HOUSE execute '{"id": PROP_ID}' --gas 300000000000000 --accountId YOU
```

# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

## v1.1.0 (2023-10-21)

### Features

- New field in the smart contract `class_metadata`.
- New method `admin_set_class_metadata`.
- New view `class_metadata`.
- `admin_mint_sbt` method.

## v1.0.6 (2023-10-16)

- increase gas set to I Voted SBT mint call in the `unbond` method.

## v1.0.5 (2023-10-06)

- `winners_by_proposal`: added optional boolean argument: `ongoing`. When set to true, it will return ongoing results, rather than an empty list.

## v1.0.4 (2023-10-06)

### Breaking changes

- Updated `admin_revoke_vote` to accept list of SBTs rather a single SBT.

## v1.0.3 (2023-10-05)

- Updated `revoke_vote` and `admin_revoke_vote` to not slash bonds.
- Added `disqualify_candidates`.

## v1.0.2 (2023-10-02)

- `winners_by_proposal(prop_id)` should return empty list if the elections didn't finish.

## v1.0.1 (2023-09-28)

- Added `admin_set_finish_time` method.
- Added `finish_time` query.

### Bug Fixes

### Features

New methods:

- `admin_set_finish_time(time)`: allows the contract authority to overwrite the existing finish time (extending the cooldown).
- `finish_time()`: query the finish time (time when the cooldown is over and unbonding is possible).

## v1.0.0 (2023-09-06)

### Features

New methods:

- `bond_by_sbt` query to check if a holder of given SBT bonded.

### Breaking Changes

- `winners_by_house` renamed to ``winners_by_proposal`

### Bug Fixes

- fix the calculated amount of bonded tokens in `bond` method.
- fix the amount of winners returned in the `winners_by_house` method.

## v1.0.0-beta1 (2023-08-29)

### Features

- `I VOTED` sbt will be minted to the user in while unbonding if voted for all the proposals.

#### New call methods

- `bond` - method to allow users to bond and re-bond (increase their bond). Bonding is required to vote. [docs](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md)
- `unbond` - method to allow users to unbond the previously bonded amount. It is allowed only after the cooldown period. [docs](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md)
- `accept_fair_voting_policy` - method to allow users to accept the fair voting policy. It is required to vote. [docs](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md).

##### New query methods

- `proposal_status` - returns weather a proposal is active, at cooldown or finished.
- `accepted_policy` - returns a blake32 policy hash of the most recent accepted policy by the user.
- `user_votes` - returns all the users votes for all the proposals
- `has_voted_on_all_proposals` - returns true if user has voted on all proposals, otherwise false
- `policy` - returns the required policy
- `winners_by_house` - returns a list of winners of the proposal

### Breaking Changes

- The user needs to both accept the voting policy and bond before being allowed to vote.
- User doesn't need to make storage deposit to cover voting. Bond is used to cover that.

### Bug Fixes

# Elections Smart Contract

## Deployments

|   environment   |                           address |
| :-------------: | --------------------------------: |
|  mainnet prod   |          `elections.ndc-gwg.near` |
| mainnet testing | `elections-v1-1.gwg-testing.near` |
|     testnet     |        `elections-v1.gwg.testnet` |

## Requirements

- Only I Am Human verified accounts can vote.
- Each account can vote at most one time. Votes are not revocable, and can't be changed.
- Contract has a fair voting `policy` attribute. Each user, before voting, has to firstly accept the policy by making a transaction matching the contract policy.
- Only the authority (set during contract initialization) can create proposals. Each proposal specifies:

  - `typ`: must be HouseType variant
  - `start`: voting start time as UNIX time (in miliseconds)
  - `end`: voting start time as UNIX time (in miliseconds)
  - `cooldown`: cooldown duration when votes from blacklisted accounts can be revoked by an authority (in miliseconds)
  - `ref_link`: string (can't be empty) - a link to external resource with more details (eg near social post). Max length is 120 characters.
  - `quorum`: minimum amount of legit accounts to vote to legitimize the elections.
  - `seats`: max number of candidates to elect, also max number of credits each user has when casting a vote.
  - `min_candidate_support`: minimum amount of votes a candidate needs to receive to be considered a winner.

## Flow

- GWG deploys the elections smart contract and sets authority for creating new proposals.
- GWG authority creates new proposals before the election starts, with eligible candidates based on the `nominations` result. All proposals are created before the elections start.
  - NOTE: we may consider querying the candidates directly from the nominations contract.
- Once the proposals are created and the elections start (`now >= proposal.start`), all human verified near accounts can vote according to the NDC Elections [v1 Framework](../README.md#elections).
- Anyone can query the proposal and the ongoing result at any time.
- Voting is active until the `proposal.end` time.
- Vote revocation is active until the `proposal.end` + `cooldown` time.

## Bonding

- [SPEC](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md#bonding)
- Each verified voter must bond 3N to cast their vote. Each Non-verified voter must bond 300N to cast their vote.
- Bond can be deposited using `bond` function that must be used via is_human_call.

  ```rust
  near call REGISTRY is_human_call '{"ctr": "elections.near", "function": "bond", "payload": "{}"}' --accountId YOU.near --deposit 3
  ```

- One bond is enough to cast votes for all proposals.
- `finish_time`: max(`finish_time`, `end` + `cooldown`) of all the proposals.
- User can unbond after the `finish_time`. All tokens minus storage fees will be returned.
- Bonded tokens can be slashed by executing `vote_revoke`. 100% of bonded tokens will be slashed and will be tracked in `total_slashed` variable.
- `unbond`: To unbond deposit, unbond function needs to be called via IAH `registry.is_human_call`.

  ```rust
  near call REGISTRY is_human_call '{"ctr": "elections.near", "function": "unbond", "payload": "{}"}' --accountId YOU.near
  ```

  The `unbond` will also mint I VOTED SBT for [eligible voters](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md#i-voted-sbt).

## Voting

User who made sufficient bond and accepted Fair Voting Policy can call `vote` function to vote for an active proposal.
User can vote at most once for each proposal, votes can not be updated. [Full specification](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md)

### Setup Package

Setup Package proposal is a proposal with `seats=1` (at most one option can be selected) and `candidates = ["yes", "no", "abstain"]`.

Voting for setup package uses the same API as voting for candidates. The vote must be list of exactly one element: `["yes"]` or `["no"]` or `["abstain"]`.

## Usage

Below we show few CLI snippets:

```shell
CTR=elections-v1.gwg.testnet
REGISTRY=registry-1.i-am-human.testnet

# create proposal
# note: start time, end time and cooldown must be in milliseconds

near call $CTR create_proposal '{"start": 1686221747000, "end": 1686653747000, "cooldown": 604800000  "ref_link": "example.com", "quorum": 10, "candidates": ["candidate1.testnet", "candidate2.testnet", "candidate3.testnet", "candidate4.testnet"], "typ": "HouseOfMerit", "seats": 3, "min_candidate_support": 5}' --accountId $CTR

# vote
near call $CTR vote '{"prop_id": 1, "vote": ["candidate1.testnet", "candidate3.testnet"]}' --gas 70000000000000 --deposit 0.0005 --accountId me.testnet

# revoke vote (authority only)
near call $CTR admin_revoke_vote '{"prop_id": 1, "token_id": 1}'

# revoke vote (anyone can call this method)
near call $CTR revoke_vote '{"prop_id": 1, "user": "alice.testnet"}'

# check if a user voted for all proposals (note user votes with SBTs, so it may happen that
# we should query by TokenID instead)
near view $CTR has_voted_on_all_proposals '{"user": "alice.testnet"}'

# query winners by a proposal
# NOTE: the function doesn't return "ongoing" winners, it only returns a valid response once
# the proposal finished (voting ended and is past the cooldown).
near view $CTR winners_by_proposal '{"prop_id": 1}'
```

# Nominations

Smart contract for nominations.
[Specification](https://near-ndc.notion.site/Nominations-b4281e30ac4e44cfbd894f0e2443bc88?pvs=4)

Smart contract is primally used for NDC v1 Elections, but can be used also for other use cases (eg Kudos).

## Transactions

- `self_nominate(house: HouseType, comment: String,link: Option<String>)` - allows OG members to submit a nomination.
- `self_revoke()` - enables candidates to revoke their nomination.
- `upvote(candidate: AccountId)` - enables IAH token holders to upvote existing nominations.
- `remove_upvote(candiate: AccountId)` - removes the upvote from the caller for the specified candidate.
- `comment(candidate: AccountId, comment: String)` - enables IAH token holders to comment on existing nominations

## Queries

- `nominations(&self, house: HouseType) -> Vec<(AccountId, u32)>` - returns all the nominations for the given house with the numbers of upvotes received eg. `[("candidate1.near", 16), ("candidate2.near", 5), ...]`.

Comment and upvote queries should be go through an indexer.

# Voting Body

- [Diagrams](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMqJRr_U=/)
- [Framework Specification](https://www.notion.so/NDC-V1-Framework-V3-2-Updated-1af84fe7cc204087be70ea7ffee4d23f)

Voting Body is governance structure of all non-blacklisted human participants in the NEAR Ecosystem. There are no requirements for being a member of the voting body beyond completing ‘I am Human’ and not being on the blacklist.

Deployed Contracts

- mainnet: `voting-body-v1.ndc-gwg.near`
- testnet: `voting-body-v1.gwg.testnet`, IAH registry: `registry-unstable-v2.i-am-human.testnet`

## Contract Parameters

- `quorum`: a minimum amount of members that need to vote to approve a proposal.
- `pre_vote_support`: minimum amount of support, a proposal has to receive in order to move it to the active queue, where users can vote to approve a proposal.
- `pre_vote_duration`: max amount of time, users can express support to move a proposal to the active queue, before it will be removed.
- `pre_vote_bond`: amount of N required to add a proposal to the pre-vote queue.
- `active_queue_bond`: amount of N required to move a proposal directly to the active queue.
- `vote_duration`: max amount of time a proposal can be active in the active queue. If a proposal didn't get enough approvals by that time, it will be removed and bond returned.

You can query the parameters with:

```shell
near view VOTING_BODY config ''
```

## Creating proposals

Every human can create a proposal. The proposals are organized in 2 queues (pre-vote queue and active queue) in order to filter out spam proposals.
When creating a proposal, the submitter must stake a bond. If `pre-vote bond` is attached, then the proposal goes to the pre-vote queue. If `active_queue_bond` is attached then the proposal goes directly to active queue (_fast track_ - no need for getting a pre-vote support, but the proposer takes a responsibility of being slashed if the proposal is marked as spam).

Proposal can only be created by an IAH verified account. We use `is_human_call` method. Example call:

```shell
near call IAH_REGISTRY is_human_call \
  '{"ctr": "VB.near", "function": "create_proposal", "payload": "{\"kind\": {\"Veto\": {\"dao\": \"hom.near\", \"prop_id\": 12}}, \"description\": \"this proposal is against the budget objectives\"}"}' \
  --accountId YOU \
  --depositYocto $pre_vote_bond

# Creating a text proposal with with a active_queue_bond (making it automatically advancing to the active queue)
near call IAH_REGISTRY  is_human_call \
  '{"ctr": "VB.near", "function": "create_proposal", "payload": "{\"kind\": \"Text\", \"description\": \"lets go\"}"}' \
  --accountId YOU --deposit $active_queue_bond
```

### Pre-vote queue

Proposals in this queue are not active. VB members can't vote for proposals in the pre-vote queue and UI doesn't display them by default. Instead, members can send a _pre_vote_support_ transaction. There are 3 ways to move a proposal to the active queue:

- get `pre_vote_support` support transactions from VB members;
- top up with more NEAR to reach `active_queue_bond`;
- get a support by one of the Congress members using `support_proposal_by_congress` method.

Note: originally only a congress support was required to move a proposal to the active queue. However, that creates a strong subjectivity and censorship (example: VB wants to dismiss a house - obviously house may not be happy and not "support" such a proposal).

Voting Body Support can only be made by an IAH verified account. We use `is_human_call_lock` method, which will lock the caller for soul transfers, to avoid double support. Example call:

```shell
lock_duration=pre_vote_duration+1
near call IAH_REGISTRY is_human_call_lock \
  '{"ctr": "VB.near", "function": "support_proposal", "payload": "1", "lock_duration": '$lock_duration', "with_proof": false}' \
  --accountId YOU
```

### Active queue

Proposals in this queue are eligible for voting and displayed by the default in the UI. Proposals from the active queue are not removed unless they are marked as spam (more about it in the voting section). They are preserved and anyone can query them, even when a proposal was rejected.

When a proposal is moved from the pre-vote queue to the active queue, the set of accounts that supported the proposal is cleared - it's not needed any more. We can save the space and proposal load time.

### Proposal Types

There are several types of proposals with specific functionalities and limitations:

1. **Dismiss Proposal**

   - Arguments: `dao`: `AccountId`, `member`: `AccountId`
   - Description: This proposal calls the `Dismiss` hook in the provided DAO when executed, resulting in the removal of the specified member.

2. **Dissolve Proposal**

   - Arguments: `dao`: `AccountId`
   - Description: Executing this proposal triggers the `Dissolve` hook in the provided DAO, dissolving the DAO itself.

3. **Veto Proposal**

   - Arguments: `dao`: `AccountId`, `prop_id`: `u32`
   - Description: When executed, this proposal invokes the `Veto` hook in the provided DAO and vetoes the proposal identified by the specified `prop_id`.

4. **Approve Budget Proposal**

   - Arguments: `dao`: `AccountId`, `prop_id`: `u32`
   - Description: This type of proposal serves as an approval mechanism for budget proposals without making any method calls.

5. **Text Proposal**

   - Description: A text proposal for general purposes, without specific arguments. It doesn't involve any method calls.

6. **TextSuper Proposal**

   - Description: same as `Text` proposal, but requires Near Supermajority Consent to approve.

7. **FunctionCall Proposal**

   - Arguments: `receiver_id`: `AccountId`, `actions`: `Vec<ActionCall>`
   - Description: This proposal enables you to call the `receiver_id` with a list of method names in a single promise. It allows your contract to execute various actions in other contracts, excluding congress contracts. Attempting to create a proposal that calls any congress DAOs will result in an error, preventing the proposal from being created.

8. **UpdateBonds**

   - Arguments: `pre_vote_bond: U128`, `active_queue_bond: U128`
   - Description: allows VB to update contract configuration.

9. **UpdateVoteDuration**

   - Arguments: `pre_vote_duration: u64`, `vote_duration: u64`
   - Description: allows VB to update contract configuration.

## Proposal Lifecycle

```mermaid
---
title: Possible Proposal Status Flows
---
flowchart TB
    Trash([Trash])
    PreVote --> InProgress
    InProgress --> Approved
    InProgress --> Rejected
    InProgress --> Spam
    Approved --> Executed
    Executed -- tx fail --> Failed
    Failed -- re-execute --> Executed

    PreVote -- slashed --> Trash
    Spam -- slashed --> Trash
```

When proposal is created, but the creator doesn't deposit `active_queue_bond` immediately, then the status of a proposal is `PreVote`.
A proposal that doesn't advance to the active queue by the `pre_vote_duration` is eligible for slashing. In such case, any account can call `slash_prevote_proposal(id)` method: the proposal will be removed, `SLASH_REWARD` will be transferred (as in incentive) to the caller and the remainder bond will be sent to the community fund.

Proposal, that is moved to the active queue has status `InProgress` and keeps that status until the voting period is over (`proposal.start_time + vote_duration`). During that time all Members can vote for the proposal.

Once the voting period is over, a proposal will have `Approved`, `Rejected` or `Spam` status, based on the voting result.
During this time, anyone can call `execute(id)`. Note these statuses are only visible when we query a proposal and: a) voting is over b) and was not executed. Executing a proposal will set the `proposal.executed_at` property to the current time in milliseconds and will have the following effects:

- Approved: bonds are returned. If a proposal involves a function call, then the call is scheduled. If the call fails, the proposal will have status `Failed` and anyone will be able to re-execute it again.
- Rejected: bonds are removed, and proposal won't be able to be re-executed.
- Spam: executor will receive a `SLASH_REWARD`, and the proposal will be slashed: removed, and the remaining bond (including the top-up) send to the community fund.

## Voting

Any VB member can vote on any _in progress_ proposal in the active queue. Voter can change his/her vote multiple times. Vote options:

- approve
- reject
- spam: strong conviction that the proposal is spam, should be removed and a deposit slashed.

A proposal voting is in progress when `now <= proposal.start_time + vote_duration`, where `proposal.start_time` is a time when the proposal is added to the active queue.

Syntax: #vote_type denotes number of votes of the specified type, eg: #approve means number of approve votes.

A proposal is **approved** when:

- voting time is over;
- AND consent is reached (quorum + threshold).

A proposal is marked as **spam** when:

- voting time is over;
- `#spam > #reject`;
- AND `#reject + #spam >= (1-threshold) * (#approve + #reject + #spam)`.

Spam proposals are removed, and the bond is slashed (sent to the community treasury).

A proposal is **rejected** if voting time is over (proposal is not in progress anymore), and it was not approved nor marked as spam.

Voting Body intentionally doesn't support optimistic execution, that is approving or rejecting a proposal once sufficient amount of votes are cast. We want to give a chance to every member vote and express their opinion providing more clear outcome of the voting.

Vote can only be made by an IAH verified account. We use `is_human_call_lock` method, which will lock the caller for soul transfers, to avoid double vote. Example call:

```shell
lock_duration=vote_duration+1  # minimum value is the time in milliseconds remaining to the voting end + 1.
near call IAH_REGISTRY is_human_call_lock \
  '{"ctr": "VB.near", "function": "vote", "payload": "{\"prop_id\": 3, \"vote\": \"Approve\"}", "lock_duration": '$lock_duration', "with_proof": false}' \
  --accountId YOU \
  --deposit 0.01 # used for vote storage, reminder will be returned.

near call VOTING_BODY get_vote \
  '{"id": 3, "voter": "YOU"}'
```

### Quorums and Thresholds

**Quorum** assures that enough of the VB members voted.
**Majority Threshold** assures that enough VB members approved a proposal. It is a fractional value. Proposal is approved when: `#approve > threshold * (#approve + #reject + #spam)`. It is either a simple majority or a super majority.

- **Near Consent:** quorum=(7% of the voting body) + **simple majority**=50%.
- **Near Supermajority Consent**: quorum=(12% of the voting body) + **super majority**=60%.

### Creating a Budget Approval proposal

1. HoM must create a Budget Proposal and approve it.

2. CoA must not veto it.

3. Once cooldown is over (cooldown starts once the proposal is internally approved), and it was not vetoed, then it's finalized.

4. Any human can can now create a VB Text proposal, referencing original HoM Budget proposal, example:

   ```shell
   near call IAH_REGISTRY is_human_call \
   '{"ctr": "VB.near", "function": "create_proposal", "payload": "{\"kind\": {\"ApproveBudget\": {\"dao\": \"HOM.near\", \"prop_id\": 12}}, \"description\": \"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\"}"}' \
   --accountId YOU \
   --depositYocto $pre_vote_bond
   ```

5. Now we need to advance the proposal to the active queue. The easiest way is to ask any Congress member (HoM or other house) to support it. Below, `prop_id` must be the id of the proposal created above, `dao` must be the house address and the caller is member of (eg: `congress-hom-v1.ndc-gwg.near`).

   ```shell
   near call VB support_proposal_by_congress \
     '{"prop_id": 5, `dao`: "HOM"}' \
     --accountId YOU
   ```

6. Share the proposal ID with others and ask the VB to vote.

### Slashing a proposal

Any proposal with _Spam_ status or _PreVote_ and being overdue (see [Proposal Lifecycle](#proposal-lifecycle) section) is slasheable. Any account can trigger a slash, and in exchange he will receive the [`SLASH_REWARD`](https://github.com/near-ndc/voting-v1/blob/master/voting_body/src/constants.rs#L5).

Slashing pre vote proposal:

```shell
near call VB slash_prevote_proposal '{"id": 5}' \
  --accountId YOU
```

Slashing proposal in the active queue is as simple as executing it:

```shell
near call VB execute '{"id": 5}' \
  --accountId YOU
```

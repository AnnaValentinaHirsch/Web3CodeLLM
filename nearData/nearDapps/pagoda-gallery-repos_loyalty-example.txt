# Loyalty Program with Fungible Tokens

## About

This project is created for easy-to-start as a React + Rust loyalty program with fungible tokens template in the Pagoda Gallery. It was initialized with [create-near-app]. Use this template and start to build your own gallery project!

### Built With

[create-near-app]

Getting Started
==================

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed – we are targeting versions `16+`.

Read about other [prerequisites](https://docs.near.org/develop/prerequisites) in our docs.

### Installation

Install all dependencies:

    npm install

Build your contract:

    npm run build

Deploy your contract to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy

**Important note**: only the factory contract is and should be deployed. This is done automatically when using `npm run deploy` command. Two other contracts (ft contract and manager contract) should only be deployed by the factory contract.

Overview
================

The loyalty program with the fungible token template provides a way for merchants to create
a fungible token program with just a few clicks. 

The template consists of the following modules:

* 3 smart contracts: factory contract, fungible token contract and manager contract
* backend.js that serves as a web2 backend
* frontend that provides the UI for the customer and the merchant

## Contracts

This template features three smart contracts:

* factory contract - this is the contract that is deployed by the user. The contract uses a factory pattern
  to deploy fungible token contract and manager contract for each merchant that logs in and creates a loyalty program with the UI.
  See [factory-rust](https://github.com/near-examples/factory-rust) for a simple factory pattern.
* fungible token contract - this is a standard fungible token contract. 
  Read more about the FTs [here](https://docs.near.org/develop/relevant-contracts/ft).
* manager contract - this contract manages the whole loaylty program flow

## Frontend

Frontend consists of two views:

* merchant view - this is the view where a merchant can create a loyalty program. The merchant needs to log in first.
* customer view - the view used by the customer to use the loyalty program and gain fungible tokens.
  This view is hidden until a merchant creates a loaylty program. The customer does not have to log in or create an account
  in order to use the loyalty program. 

## Backend.js

Backend.js is a simple web2 backend simulated on the frontend in this template.

Usage
=====

Start your frontend:

    npm run dev

**Important note**: This project uses a browser local storage to store important data.
Be sure to always run it in the same browser. It won't work in an incognito mode.

Test your contract:

    npm test

Exploring The App
=================

The project deploys a pair of contracts for each merchant. The naming convention for those is:

Manager contract: `{random id tied to a merchant}-manager.{factory address}`
FT contract: `{random id tied to a merchant}-ft.{factory address}`

A customer account is created as a subaccount of a manager contract:

`{random string of 4 chars}.{random id tied to a merchant}-manager.{factory address}`

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The smart-contract code lives in the `/contracts` folder.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/frontend/pages/index.js`,
   this is your entrypoint to learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. There is a backend code in the `backend.js` file in the `frontend` directory. This code
   simulates a web2 backend.
4. Test your contract: `npm test`, this will run the tests in `integration-tests` directory.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer using any of the [private contact addresses](https://github.com/near/boilerplate-template-rs#support). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html>

For answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq>

        Congratulations! You just created a loyalty program! The factory contract deployed a pair of contracts assigned
        to your account: manager contract and FT contract. The FT contract was initialized with the fungible token
        metadata that you provided in the previous step. Go to 'contracts' directory to learn more.
        <br />
        <br />
        This project is just a template and some things are simplified. The web2 backend is simulated on the frontend
        (see: frontend/backend.js). As long as you are logged in, the backend remains in the active state and customers
        can use your loyalty program.
        <br />
        <br />
        Click 'Open customer app' to see how a customer can interact with your loyalty program. This is a separate
        service that communicates both with the backend and the FT contract to get and spend some tokens that you just
        created.
        <br />
        <br />
        Clicking on 'Open customer app' generates a link with merchant account id. That's how your account id is passed
        to the customer app. The factory contract stores information about all loyalty programs deployed by merchants.
        This information is fetched by the customer app.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you log out, the customer app will be deactivated. Log in again to activate the backend for the customer app.

## To build smart contracts

```bash
cd contracts
```

```bash
./build.sh
```

## To deploy smart contracts

```bash
. ./deploy.sh
```

> additional dot is required for running shell script in current session, so that all required parameters will be initialized correctly

## Get Some ELEMENT Token in your Near wallet

```bash
ID=<YOUR_WALLET_ID>
echo $ID
```

```bash
near call $element storage_deposit '' --accountId $ID --amount 0.00125
```

```bash
near call $element ft_transfer '{"receiver_id": "'$ID'", "amount": "30"}' --accountId $element --amount 0.000000000000000000000001
```

Now get dev account id from .env file and replace that address with element-app/.env account id

## Try out frontend

```bash
cd .. && cd element-app
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run develop
```

# The Element Project

The Element Project is an example of an environmental DeFi app with the goal of channeling the DeFi funding
towards environmental goods. We had discussed many ideas related to tracking deforestation/reforestation,
and those would be wonderful projects to bring to production, but given the time constraints of the hackathon,
we decided on a metric that changed much more quickly... Air Quality.

The goal is to make visible the invisible - in this case air pollution - and allow people to profit when they can
reduce it. An investor can place ELEMENT tokens on a given area and then work/lobby/tweet to improve the air quality.
Several months later, when the investment is mature, we compare the new air quality with the original quality and
reward the investor with a return based on the change. If the pollution levels decrease, they get more ELEMENT back.
If pollution increases, they lose ELEMENT (do not get all their initial investment back).

For the prototype, we have a quite short investment duration (7 days),
but any real system should configure this for several months and use a time-averaged value to encourage long-term improvements

This document provides a high-level overview of the project. You can also get information on [how to run this code](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Data Sources

For the original data, we use [Emissions API](https://emissions-api.org/), which is based on public domain
ESA (European Space Agency) satellite data. We poll the data for the last several months for the US, and
then combine it into a standard grid, so nearby measurements are grouped together.

The first product is measuring Methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas.

Further work would be to normalize the data to remove some of the noise/variation. This could be done by
averaging, but also we would like to investigate if there is a high correlation between wind/rain and
pollution levels (high wind or rain removing atmospheric pollution) and if so, we could compensate for this
correlation by reading in historical weather information and processing the data from Emissions API, before
we perform some time averaging on it.

Once we have "clean data" for one metric, we would like to add the other frequently updated pollution sources
(carbon monoxide and ozone), preprocess them as above, and then combine them to produce a combine index
that represents a more holistic view of air quality.

We chose one country to limit the scale of the data we work with. And chose the USA, as it is the most widely
recognized country.

## Hexagons

Since every measurement is at a slightly different location, we need to group them together in a reasonable
spatial resolution to allow meaningful aggregation and historical data. To do so, we searched for a regular grid system
that covers the planet and went with the [H3 Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index](https://eng.uber.com/h3/).

This can easily be adjusted to different spatial resolutions and covers the whole globe with mostly-equally sized
hexagons in contrast to e.g. the distortion of squares in the Mercator projection.

## Frontend App

The frontend app provides the user access to both the data platform and the blockchain.
It queries the latest values of all grid points from the data platform, and when you click on a hexagon, it will
also show a graph of the historical values of pollution.

We use Near test wallet to connect to Near's testnet. The application currently runs in a local environment, follow the
instructions to test it locally.

Once you have connected your wallet and filled it with tokens, you can browse the different hexagons and invest in the
one(s) that you would like to clean up. We display all your current investments in the sidebar, and also allow
you to withdraw any investments that have reached maturity, calculating your winnings.

## Contracts

We use [rust contracts](https://github.com/Pranav543/metabuild-hackathon-project/tree/main/contracts) deployed on NEAR to handle
the blockchain side.

/*!
Fungible Token implementation with JSON serialization.
NOTES:
  - The maximum balance value is limited by U128 (2**128 - 1).
  - JSON calls should pass U128 as a base-10 string. E.g. "100".
  - The contract optimizes the inner trie structure by hashing account IDs. It will prevent some
    abuse of deep tries. Shouldn't be an issue, once NEAR clients implement full hashing of keys.
  - The contract tracks the change in storage before and after the call. If the storage increases,
    the contract requires the caller of the contract to attach enough deposit to the function call
    to cover the storage cost.
    This is done to prevent a denial of service attack on the contract by taking all available storage.
    If the storage decreases, the contract will issue a refund for the cost of the released storage.
    The unused tokens from the attached deposit are also refunded, so it's safe to
    attach more deposit than required.
  - To prevent the deployed contract from being modified or deleted, it should not have any access
    keys on its account.

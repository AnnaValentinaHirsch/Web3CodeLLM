Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] ≥ 12
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Go into frontend folder and run `npm install` to install Typescript and Tailwind.
4. Run the frontend from the frontend folder using: `npm run dev`

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the smart
   contract. See `contract/README` for info about how it's tested.

Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.

Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    yarn install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `template.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `template.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account template.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'template.YOUR-NAME.testnet'

Step 3: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`:

1. builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet

template Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]

Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`. You can compile and deploy the contract running ./build.sh. To make it executable run `chmod u+x build.sh`. After making it executable run `./build.sh` this will build and deploy the contract.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.

// This file does two things:

// 1. Compile the Rust contract using cargo (see buildCmd below). This will

// 2. Create a symbolic link (symlink) to the generated wasm file in the root
//    project's `out` folder, for easy use with near-cli.
//
// First, import some helper libraries. `shelljs` is included in the
// devDependencies of the root project, which is why it's available here. It
// makes it easy to use *NIX-style scripting (which works on Linux distros,
// macOS, and Unix systems) on Windows as well.

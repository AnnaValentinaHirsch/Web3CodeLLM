# Clawback
<embed src="/snippets/_clawback-disclaimer.md" />
For regulatory purposes, some issuers must have the ability to recover issued tokens after they are distributed to accounts. For example, if an issuer were to discover that tokens were sent to an account sanctioned for illegal activity, the issuer could recover, or *claw back*, the funds.

Issuers can create tokens that they can claw back by adding the `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` flag to the issuing account.

**Note:** You can only claw back issued tokens created by your account. You cannot claw back XRP in this way.

Clawback is disabled by default. To use clawback, you must set the `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` flag through an `AccountSet` transaction. The `AccountSet` transaction only succeeds if the account has an empty owner directory, meaning that the account has no trustlines, offers, escrows, payment channels, or checks. After you set this flag, it cannot reverted. The account permanently gains the ability to claw back issued assets on trustlines.

If you attempt to set `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` while `lsfNoFreeze` is set, the transaction returns `tecNO_PERMISSION`, because clawback cannot be enabled on an account that has already disclaimed the ability to freeze trustlines. 
Conversely, if you try to set `lsfNoFreeze` while `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` is set, the transaction also returns `tecNO_PERMISSION`.

## Example Clawback Transaction

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "Clawback",
  "Account": "rp6abvbTbjoce8ZDJkT6snvxTZSYMBCC9S",
  "Amount": {
      "currency": "FOO",
      "issuer": "rsA2LpzuawewSBQXkiju3YQTMzW13pAAdW",
      "value": "314.159"
    }
}
```

In execution, this transaction would claw back at most 314.159 FOO issued by rp6abvbTbjoce8ZDJkT6snvxTZSYMBCC9S and held by rsA2LpzuawewSBQXkiju3YQTMzW13pAAdW. If rsA2LpzuawewSBQXkiju3YQTMzW13pAAdW does not have a trustline set up or that trustline's balance is 0, then the error `tecNO_LINE` is returned and a fee is consumed.

## Clawback Fields

In addition to the common fields, `Clawback` transactions use the following fields:

| Field              | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Description       |
|:-------------------|:----------|:------------------|:------------------|
| `TransactionType`  | string    | `UINT16`          | Indicates the new transaction type `Clawback`. The integer value is `30`. The name is `ttCLAWBACK`. |
| `Account`          | string    | `ACCOUNT ID`      | The account executing this transaction. The account must be the issuer of the asset being clawed back. Note that in the XRP Ledger, trustlines are bidirectional and, under some configurations, both sides can be seen as the "issuer" of an asset. In this specification, the term issuer is used to mean the side of the trustline that has an outstanding balance (that is, 'owes' the issued asset) that it wants to claw back.|
| `Flags`            | number    | `UINT32`          | (Optional) The universal transaction flags that are applicable to all transactions (for example, `tfFullyCanonicalSig`) are valid. This proposal introduces no new transaction-specific flags. |
| `Amount`           | object     | `AMOUNT`          | Indicates the amount being clawed back, as well as the counterparty from which the amount is being clawed back from. |

It is not an error if the amount exceeds the holder's balance; in that case, the maximum available balance is clawed back. It returns `temBAD_AMOUNT` if the amount is zero.

It is an error if the counterparty listed in `Amount` is the same as the `Account` issuing this transaction; the transaction fails execution with `temBAD_AMOUNT`.

If there doesn't exist a trustline with the counterparty or that trustline's balance is 0, the error `tecNO_LINE` is returned.

The sub-field `issuer` within `Amount` represents the token holder's account ID rather than the issuer's.

## lsfAllowTrustLineClawback

Clawback is disabled by default. To use clawback, you must set the `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` flag through an `AccountSet` transaction. The `AccountSet` transaction only succeeds if the account has an empty owner directory, meaning that the account has no trustlines, offers, escrows, payment channels, or checks. After you set this flag, it cannot reverted. The account permanently gains the ability to claw back issued assets on trustlines.

If you attempt to set `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` while `lsfNoFreeze` is set, the transaction returns `tecNO_PERMISSION`, because clawback cannot be enabled on an account that has already disclaimed the ability to freeze trustlines. 
Conversely, if you try to set `lsfNoFreeze` while `lsfAllowTrustLineClawback` is set, the transaction also returns `tecNO_PERMISSION`.

# Bootstrap a Local Environment

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

The `boostrap` command enables you to create a local development environment. This environment consists of:

- A blockchain configured with nodes and extra accounts.
- An XRP bridge with witnesses configured.
- An EVM explorer that enables you to monitor the network and transactions.

1. Create a JSON config file in this format:

    ```json
    {
        "blockchain": {
            "chainId": "1440002",
            "nodes": 3
        },
        "bridge": {
            "xrplRpc": "wss://sidechain-net1.devnet.rippletest.net",
            "xrplSeed": "***",
            "minCreateAmount": 50,
            "minRewardAmount": 1,
            "quorum": 1,
            "witnesses": [
                {
                    "type": "local",
                    "evmAddress": "0x96329A50d10a3F69311E4f4E108672926c51c474",
                    "evmPrivateKey": "***",
                    "xrpAddress": "rpSspP5yYyomcSrgsohyKMCnu5oJsTMkYP",
                    "xrpPrivateKey": "****"
                }
            ]
        },
        "explorer": {
            "disable": false
        }
    }
    ```

2. Specify where to export all the environment data.

    ```bash
    evmcli blockchain bootstrap -c bootstrap-config.json -e $PWD/data
    ```

3. Run the environment locally from inside the exported data folder.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

# Bridge Door Safety Mechanisms

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

This page describes the options you have to mitigate any risks that may occur during the life of a bridge. None of these mechanisms can be activated by a single witness; only transactions executed from the Gnosis Safe can activate them.

## Disable Module

This option deactivates the permissions for a bridge door to transfer safe assets. This transaction is native and included in the Gnosis Safe specification. When the call to the disable module contract is executed, the bridge is disabled and won't be able to transfer any assets from the safe.

To learn how to disable gnosis modules, see: [Protocol Kit](https://docs.safe.global/reference/protocol-kit).

## Pause Bridge Door

This option pauses the smart contract, blocking any calls to the contract until it's unpaused. See: [Bridge Door Interface](bridge-door-interface.md#pause)

This mechanism is implemented with the _OpenZeppelin Pausable_ standard. To learn more about the standard, see: [Lifecylce](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/lifecycle).

## Execute Transaction

This option executes a _call_ or _delegatecall_ from the bridge door itself. This is useful in cases where funds are blocked or the bridge door needs to be modified.

```solidity
function execute(
        address to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes memory data,
        Enum.Operation operation
    ) public onlyOwner returns (bool success) {
        uint256 txGas = type(uint256).max;
        if (operation == Enum.Operation.DelegateCall) {
            // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
            assembly {
                success := delegatecall(txGas, to, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0)
            }
        } else {
            // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
            assembly {
                success := call(txGas, to, value, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0)
            }
        }
    }

# Bridge Doors

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

Bridge doors on the EVM sidechain are _Solidity_ smart contracts that have the logic to execute all transactions introduced by XLS-38d.

The bridge doors don't hold any assets, instead sending them to a Gnosis Safe multisig account.

Bridge doors require permissions to execute safe transactions, unlocking assets when enough attestations are received for an event. As such, there is a close relationship between a bridge door and Gnosis Safe. If at any time the bridge governers want to pause or deactivate the bridge, they can disable the bridge's permissions to execute any more operations.

# Bridges

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

Bridges are mechanisms that connect two blockchains together, enabling interoperability between the two. This connection enables users to transfer data or digital assets across separate blockchains that may have different protocols, consensus mechanisms, and other underlying technologies.

Amendment draft XLS-38d introduces bridges to the XRP Ledger. To learn more about the specifics of the XRPL bridge implementation, see: [XLS-38d-XChainBridge](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-38d-XChainBridge).

## Bridge Governance

XLS-38d uses an `XChainCreateBridge` transaction to create a bridge by designating door accounts to manage the transfer of assets between blockchains. Door accounts are managed by a list of signers, requiring a specific quorum to approve transactions.

These specialized door accounts don't exist natively on EVM compatible blockchains, so _Gnosis Safe_ is used as an alternate signer list system to manage bridge governance. Gnosis Safe uses smart contracts to manage multisig accounts; the smarts contracts are audited and used in other projects, such as Makr, ENS, and AAVE.

Before creating a bridge, you must create a Gnosis Safe account with a list of owners and a quorum threshold. You can then use the Gnosis account as a door account to manage assets, signers, and quorum.

**Notes:**
    - The EVM sidechain offers a custom implementation of the Gnosis Safe management service. See: [https://safe-evm-poa-sidechain.peersyst.tech/](https://safe-evm-poa-sidechain.peersyst.tech/)
    - You can learn more about Gnosis Safe from their public documents. See: [https://docs.safe.global/](https://docs.safe.global/)

## EVM Sidechain Bridge Implementation

The EVM sidechain utilizes these components in its implementation of the bridge:

- [_Solidity_ smart contracts](bridge-doors.md) to implement the new transactions introduced by XLS-38d.
- [Witness servers](witness-servers.md) to sign attestations.
- A [Bridge client](bridge-client.md) UI to interact with the bridge.

# Configure the Bridge Client

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

The client requires separate configuration files for the backend frontend. Each environment setting also requires its own configuration files.

## Backend Configuration

The client backend is configured in `src/config`. The folder holds multiple files that configure properties related to the:

- Server
- Logger
- Database (TypeORM)
- EVM
- XRPL
- XUMM

These configuration files use the `buildConfig()` function, taking an object with the configuration properties and a second optional parameter to perform validations. Configuration properties can have a static value or an object specifying values for each environment. The following environments are available:

- `default`
- `production`
- `development`
- `test`
- `staging`

Configuration values can be constants, environment variables or AWS Secrets. Environment variables are defined in a .env file in the root of the backend. AWS Secrets add an extra layer of customisation and security. To load AWS secrets, the `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_SECRET_ID` environment variables must be defined.

**Warning:** Never use constants for sensitive data, such as keys or secrets in production environments.

### Server Options

| Key | Description | EVN Key | AWS Secret | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|------------|---------|

# Deploy a Bridge

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

Before deploying a bridge, familiarize yourself with the parameters and terms used:

- **Currency:** The currency used by the bridge. Depending on the token, the bridge has different setups. If the currency is XRP, the door account is called a _Native Bridge Door_; if the currency is a token, the door account is called a _Token Bridge Door_.
- **Locking Chain:** The chain where the token originally exists. If the locking chain is an XRPL chain, the bridge IOU issuer isn't the bridge door account. If the locking chain is an EVM chain, the ERC20 owner isn't the bridge door account.
- **Issuing Chain:** The chain the token is bridged to. If the issuing chain is an XRPL chain, the bridged IOU issuer is the bridge door account. If the issuing chain is an EVM chain, the bridged ERC20 owner is the bridge door account and can mint/burn tokens.
- **Owners:** The witnesses addresses. For each witness, you must have its address on both chains.
- **Threshold:** The amount of attestations needed for each operation.
- **Signautre Reward:** The reward distributed to witnesses for providing attestations.
- **Minimum Create Account:** For native XRP bridges, this parameter sets the minimum amount of XRP that needs to be locked in order to execute a create account operation.

## Create a Safe Account

Before deploying a bridge, you have to create a Gnosis Safe. The safe is the multisig account that manages all of the bridge's assets.

1. Connect a wallet to the [Gnosis Safe management platform](https://safe-evm-poa-sidechain.peersyst.tech/).

![Connect a Wallet](../../images/evm-connect-wallet.png "Connect a Wallet")

2. Click **+ Create New Safe**.

![Create New Safe](../../images/evm-create-safe.png "Create New Safe")

- Give the safe a name to identify it locally.
- The owners are the bridge witnesses.
- The threshold is the amount of signatures required to make a transaction on the bridge.

Before submitting, check your information on the review screen.

![Review Safe Info](../../images/evm-safe-owners.png "Review Safe Info")

A prompt will appear, asking to sign the transaction. Carefully review the transaction details before signing it. Once the transaction is submitted, you'll see a success screen.

## Deploy the Bridge Doors

Depending on the bridge currency you want to deploy, there are different steps. Choose the correct bridge type below:

### XRP Native Bridge

XRP bridges are a rare case and should only have one bridge per mainchain and sidechain pair. The sidechain specification forces the XRP issuer account to be `rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh`.

To deploy an XRP bridge door smart contract, run this typescript command:

```typescript
import { BridgeDoorNative__factory } from "@peersyst/xrp-evm-contracts/dist/typechain/factories/BridgeDoorNative__factory";
import { xrplAccountToEvmAddress } from "./util/address-derivation";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const safeAddress = "0x...";
const lockingBridgeAddress = "r1..."; // Address of the XRPL bridge
const minRewardAmount = "1";
const minCreateAmount = "50";

const signerWallet = new ethers.Wallet("0..."); // Private key with balance

const bridgeDoorNativeFactory = new BridgeDoorNative__factory(signerWallet);
const bridgeDoorNative = await bridgeDoorNativeFactory.deploy(
    safeAddress,
    ethers.utils.parseEther(minRewardAmount),
    ethers.utils.parseEther(minCreateAmount),
    ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    xrplAccountToEvmAddress(lockingBridgeAddress),
);
const bridgeAddress = bridgeDoorNative.address;
```

### Token Bridge

Token bridges are more common than XRP bridges, so you'll most likely deploy this type.

To deploy a token bridge door smart contract, run this typescript command on the locking chain:

```typescript
import { BridgeDoorNative__factory } from "@peersyst/xrp-evm-contracts/dist/typechain/factories/BridgeDoorNative__factory";
import { xrplAccountToEvmAddress } from "./util/address-derivation";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const safeAddress = "0x...";
const issuingBridgeAddress = "r1..."; // Address of the XRPL brige
const tokenAddress = "0x..."; // Address of the ERC20 to bridge
const tokenCode = "PER";
const minRewardAmount = "1";
const minCreateAmount = "50";

const signerWallet = new ethers.Wallet("0..."); // Private key with balance

const bridgeDoorTokenFactory = new BridgeDoorToken__factory(signerWallet);
const bridgeDoorToken = await bridgeDoorTokenFactory.deploy(
    safeAddress,
    ethers.utils.parseEther(minRewardAmount),
    ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    tokenAddress,
    xrplAccountToEvmAddress(issuingBridgeAddress),
    xrplAccountToEvmAddress(issuingBridgeAddress),
    tokenCode,
    "",
);

const bridgeAddress = bridgeDoorToken.address;
```

Next, run this typescript command on the issuing chain:

```typescript
import { BridgeDoorNative__factory } from "@peersyst/xrp-evm-contracts/dist/typechain/factories/BridgeDoorNative__factory";
import { xrplAccountToEvmAddress } from "./util/address-derivation";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const safeAddress = "0x...";
const lockingBridgeAddress = "r1..."; // Address of the XRPL brige
const lockingTokenAddress = "r2..."; // Address of the IOU issuer or address of the ERC20 in the locking chain
const lockingTokenCode = "USD";
const minRewardAmount = "1";
const minCreateAmount = "50";

const signerWallet = new ethers.Wallet("0..."); // Private key with balance

const bridgeDoorTokenFactory = new BridgeDoorToken__factory(signerWallet);
const bridgeDoorToken = await bridgeDoorTokenFactory.deploy(
    safeAddress,
    ethers.utils.parseEther(minRewardAmount),
    xrplAccountToEvmAddress(lockingBridgeAddress),
    xrplAccountToEvmAddress(lockingTokenAddress),
    ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    lockingTokenCode,
    `Bridged ${lockingTokenCode} (${tokenAddress})`,
);

const bridgeAddress = bridgeDoorToken.address;
const tokenAddress = await bridgeDoorToken._tokenAddress();
```

## Authorize the Bridge Door

Enable the safe module to authorize the bridge door to execute transactions. You can do this from the [Gnosis Safe off-chain management platform](https://safe-evm-poa-sidechain.peersyst.tech/).

1. Click **Use Transaction Builder**.

    ![Use Transaction Builder](../../images/evm-use-transaction-builder.png "Use Transaction Builder")

2. Enter these fields:
    - **Enter Address or ENS Name:** The address of the safe you created.
    - **Enter ABI:**
        ```
        [{
            "inputs": [
                {
                "internalType": "address",
                "name": "module",
                "type": "address"
                }
            ],
            "name": "enableModule",
            "outputs": [],
            "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
            "type": "function"
        }]
        ```
    - **To Address:** The address of the safe you created.
    - **Contract Method Selector:** _enableModule_
    - **module (address):** The address of the bridge door smart contract you deployed.

3. Click **Add Transaction** to add it to the batch.

    
    ![Create Batch](../../images/evm-batch.png "Create Batch")

4. Click **Create Batch**.

5. Review the transaction information is correct before clicking **Send Batch**.

6. If the threshold of the safe is one, you can click **Submit**. Otherwise, the other owners of the safe need to review and sign the transaction before you can submit it to the network.

    ![Submit Transaction](../../images/evm-submit-transaction.png "Submit Transaction")

    You can check on the status of signatures from the **Transactions** tab.

    ![Review Transaction Signatures](../../images/evm-review-transaction-signatures.png "Review Transaction Signatures")

7. Check the module is enabled from **Settings** > **Modules**.

    ![Check Modules](../../images/evm-check-modules.png "Check Modules")

    After the module is enabled, witnesses can send attestations and the bridge can begin operating.

# EVM Sidechain Validator Security

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

Each validator candidate is encouraged to run its operations independently, as diverse setups increase the resilience of the network. Validator candidates should begin their setup phase now, to be on time for launch.

## Horcrux

Horcrux is a [multi-party-computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) signing service for Tendermint nodes.
 
- Composed of a cluster of signer nodes in place of the [remote signer](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/remote-signer.html), thereby enabling High Availability (HA) for block signing through fault tolerance.
- Secures your validator private key by splitting it across multiple private signer nodes using threshold Ed25519 signatures.
- Adds security and availability without sacrificing block sign performance.

For information on how to upgrade your validator infrastructure with Horcrux, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux/blob/main/docs/migrating.md). 

## Tendermint KMS

Tendermint KMS is a signature service with support for Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), such as YubiHSM 2 and Ledger Nano. It is intended to be run alongside XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain validators, ideally on separate physical hosts, providing defense-in-depth for online validator signing keys, double signing protection, and a central signing service that can be used when running multiple validators in several zones. <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: kms, hsms, yubihsm, yubikey -->

## Hardware Security Modules (HSM)

You must ensure that an attacker cannot steal a validator's key. Otherwise, the entire stake delegated to the compromised validator at risk. Hardware security modules (HSM) help mitigate this risk.

HSMs must support **`ed25519` signatures for Evmos**. The [YubiHSM 2](https://www.yubico.com/products/hardware-security-module/) supports `ed25519` and can be used with this YubiKey [library](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/yubihsm.rs). <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: evmos -->

**IMPORTANT**: The YubiHSM can protect a private key but **cannot ensure** in a secure setting that it will not sign the same block twice. <!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: will -->

## Sentry Nodes (DDOS Protection)

Validators are responsible for ensuring that the network can sustain denial of service attacks.

One recommended way to mitigate these risks is for validators to carefully structure their network topology in a sentry node architecture.

Validator nodes should only connect to full-nodes they trust; either they run these nodes themselves, or the nodes are run by other validator administrators they know personally. A validator node typically runs in a data center. Most data centers provide direct links to the networks of major cloud providers. The validator can use those links to connect to sentry nodes in the cloud. This shifts the burden of denial-of-service from the validator's node directly to its sentry nodes, and might require new sentry nodes be spun up or activated to mitigate attacks on existing ones.

Sentry nodes can be quickly spun up or change their IP addresses. Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an internet-based attacked cannot disturb them directly. This ensures that the validator's block proposals and votes always make it to the rest of the network.

To set up your sentry node architecture:

1. Edit your validator node's `config.toml` file:

```sql
#Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to
#Do not add private peers to this list if you don't want them advertised
persistent_peers =[list of sentry nodes]

# Set true to enable the peer-exchange reactor
pex = false
```

2. Edit your sentry node's `config.toml` file:

```sql
#Comma separated list of peer IDs to keep private (will not be gossiped to other peers)
#Example ID: 3e16af0cead27979e1fc3dac57d03df3c7a77acc@3.87.179.235:26656

private_peer_ids = "node_ids_of_private_peers"
```

# Execute Bridge Operations

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a bridge account and transfering funds from the issuing chain to the locking chain.

## Create Bridge Account

This operation only works for XRP bridges and can only be done once per account. If the destination account already exists or has previously executed a create account operation, this transactions will fail and you'll lose the funds used to create it.

Before running this operation, you'll need:

- A config file exported by the `bridge create` command.
- A private key with enough funds on the issuing chain.
- The destination address to receive the funds.

Run this command to create the bridge account:

```bash
evmcli bridge transact create-account \
    --config ./usd-bridge.json \
    --origin evm \
    --origin-private-key 0x... \
    --destination rB2c... \
    --amount 100
```

## Bridge Claim

This operation transfers funds between accounts on separate chains.

Run this command:

```bash
evmcli bridge transact claim \
    --config ./usd-bridge.json \
    --origin evm \
    --origin-private-key 0x... \
    --destination-private-key s15b... \
    --amount 100
```

These commands create an:

- `XChainCreateClaim` transaction on the locking chain.
- `XChainCommit` transaction on the issuing chain.

# Get Started with the EVM Sidechain

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

This getting started tutorial walks you through the steps to set up your account and submit a transaction using the EVM sidechain bridge. 

## 1. Create an Account Using an EVM Compatible Wallet
<!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: wallet -->

In order to interact with the network, you need to create an account in the EVM sidechain. To create and manage this account you can use any EVM compatible wallet such as MetaMask.

For instructions on how to install and create an account using MetaMask, see [Connect MetaMask to XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain](connect-metamask-to-xrpl-evm-sidechain.md).

## 2. Assign your XRP Ledger Devnet Tokens to the EVM Sidechain

Before you can start interacting with the EVM blockchain, you need to assign some of your XRP Ledger Devnet Tokens to the EVM Sidechain. 

To generate tokens in the XRP Ledger Devnet, go to the [XRP Faucets](https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html) page and click **Generate Devnet credentials** to generate a new Devnet account with some test XRP in it.

![Generate XRP Ledger Devnet credentials](../img/evm-sidechain-xrpl-devnet-faucet.png '#width=300px;')

Note the address and secret associated with your Devnet address. You need this information to set up your preferred XRP Ledger wallet. 

## 3. Submit a Transaction Using the EVM Sidechain Bridge

Once you have your accounts set up and test fund allocated, submit a transaction to assign some of your test tokens from the XRP Ledger Devnet to the EVM Sidechain using the EVM Sidechain bridge.

The EVM Sidechain bridge is a tool that enables transactions between chains in a fast and secure way.

### 1. Connect Both Wallets

**Connect Xumm Wallet**

Use your Xumm wallet to interact with the XRP Ledger Devnet chain.
Ensure that you have created an account on the public XRP Ledger Devnet as described in Step 1. 

To connect a Xumm wallet to the bridge, go to [EVM sidechain bridge](https://witness-evm-sidechain.peersyst.tech/) and click **Connect Xumm Wallet**.

![Connect XUMM Wallet](../img/evm-sidechain-connect-xumm-wallet.png '#width=500px;')

**Note:** Ensure that you are connected to XRP Ledger Devnet and that the application that you are connecting with is the correct one.

Follow the instructions on screen to scan the QR code using the Xumm app. The Xumm wallet app displays a confirmation page.

![Connect to XRP Ledger Devnet](../img/evm-sidechain-bridge-sign-in.jpg '#width=300px;')

**Connect MetaMask Wallet**

Use your MetaMask wallet to interact with the XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain. 
Ensure that you have created a MetaMask account and connected to the public XRP Ledger Devnet as described in [Connect MetaMask to XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain](connect-metamask-to-xrpl-evm-sidechain.md).

To connect a MetaMask wallet to the bridge, go to the [EVM sidechain bridge](https://witness-evm-sidechain.peersyst.tech/) and click **Connect Metamask Wallet**.

![Connect MetaMask Wallet](../img/evm-sidechain-connect-metamask.png '#width=300px;')

### 2. Start the Transaction 

Now that both Xumm and MetaMask wallets are connected to the bridge, you can select the direction of the bridge, the amount, and the address to fund.

- **Direction of the bridge**: The direction can be either EVM sidechain → XRP Ledger Devnet or XRP Ledger Devnet → EVM sidechain. Use the **Switch Network** button to switch the direction.
- **From Amount**: This is the transaction amount. Note that there is a fee to use the bridge.
    - Network fees: The fees required by the network for your transactions.
    - Commission: The bridge applies a commission for every transaction completed. This is to prevent spam and distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).
- **Destination Address**: The address on the chain where you want the funds.

    ![Start the transaction](../img/evm-sidechain-initiate-transfer.png '#width=500px;')

Enter the details for your transaction and click **Transfer**. Review the details of the transaction carefully before accepting the transaction in the corresponding wallet. 

![Approve the transaction](../img/evm-sidechain-approve-transaction.png '#width=500px;')

Once you approve the transaction in either the Xumm Wallet or Metamask (depending on the direction of the transfer), a loading screen displays. This process can take up to a few minutes.

![Transaction in progress](../img/evm-sidechain-transfer-in-progress.png '#width=500px;')

### 3. Receive the Funds

After a few minutes of transaction processing time, you are redirected to the **Transaction Confirmation** screen where you can verify the details of the bridge transaction.

- **Origin transaction hash**: Hash of the transaction in the origin chain.
- **Destination transaction hash**: Hash of the transaction in the destination chain.
- **From address**: Address on the origin chain.
- **To address**: Address on the destination chain.
- **Receive**: The amount received in the destination address.

![Transaction confirmation](../img/evm-sidechain-transaction-confirmation.png '#width=500px;')

Your transaction has completed successfully and the test XRP tokens are now available in the other chain.

# Introduction to EVM Compatible XRP Ledger Sidechain

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible XRP Ledger sidechain is a fast and secure blockchain that brings web3 applications to the XRP Ledger community.

- Explorer: [https://evm-sidechain.xrpl.org](https://evm-sidechain.xrpl.org)
- Public RPC: [https://rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org](https://rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org)
- Bridge UI: [https://bridge.devnet.xrpl.org]( https://bridge.devnet.xrpl.org/)

Some highlights of the EVM sidechain include:

- Support for 1000 transactions per second, enabling large loads and throughput.
- Low transaction confirmation times, producing a block every 5 seconds.
- 1 block finalization time; once a block is added to the chain and confirmed, it's considered final.
- Full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, enabling you to connect your wallet and interact with or deploy smart contracts written in Solidity. <!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: wallet -->

## Consensus

The EVM sidechain runs on a proof of authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. Proof of authority gives a designated number of blockchain actors the power to:

- Validate transactions or interactions on the network.
- Update the network's registry.
- Add new validators to the network.

Validating machines on the network are then responsible for generating new blocks of transactions to include on the blockchain.

The underlying technology for the XRPL sidechain consensus is CometBFT, a fork of [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/), which is a Byzantine fault tolerant engine for building blockchains.

The blockchain uses the `cosmos-sdk` library on top of CometBFT to create and customize the blockchain using its built-in modules. The EVM sidechain uses the [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint) `cosmos-sdk` module to provides EVM compatibility.

If you are interested in running your own node, please see: [Join the XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain Devnet](join-evm-sidechain-devnet.md).

## Interoperability Using the EVM Sidechain

The EVM sidechain is directly connected to XRP Ledger through the XRPL bridge [https://bridge.devnet.xrpl](https://bridge.devnet.xrpl.org/). Through this bridge, you can connect to the EVM Sidechain and use its features.

# Join the XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain Devnet

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

This tutorial walks you through the steps to join the existing **XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain Devnet**. 

For ease of use, create an alias, `exprd`, to run all commands inside your Docker container.

## EVM Sidechain Node Hardware Requirements

- Linux/AMD64 operating system.
- 4 or more physical CPU cores.
- At least 500GB of NVME SSD disk storage.
- At least 32GB of RAM.
- At least 100Mbps network bandwidth.

## Pre-requisites

Before proceeding to initialize the node, ensure that the following pre-requisites are installed and running:

* Docker 19+
* Create an alias to run all commands in this tutorial inside a Docker container: 

    ```bash
    alias exrpd="docker run -it --rm -v ~/.exrpd:/root/.exrpd peersyst/xrp-evm-blockchain:latest exrpd"
    ```

## Initialize Node

The first task is to initialize the node, which creates the necessary validator and node configuration files. 

1. Initialize the chain parameters using the following command:

    ```bash
    exrpd config chain-id exrp_1440002-1
    ```

2. Create or add a key to your node. For this tutorial, we use the `test` keyring:

    ```bash
    exrpd keys add <key_name> --keyring-backend test
    ```

    Note the `key_name` you enter as you need to reference it in subsequent steps.

    **Note** For more information on a more secure setup for your validator, refer to [cosmos-sdk keys and keyrings](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/keyring.html) and [validator security](evm-sidechain-validator-security.md).

3. Initialize the node using the following command:

    ```bash
    exrpd init <your_custom_moniker> --chain-id exrp_1440002-1
    ```

    Monikers can contain only ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters renders your node unreachable.

All these commands create your `~/.exrpd` (i.e `$HOME`) directory with subfolders `config/` and `data/`. In the `config` directory, the most important files for configuration are `app.toml` and `config.toml`.

## Genesis & Seeds

1. Copy the Genesis File.

    Download the `genesis.json` file from here and copy it to the `config` directory: `~/.exrpd/config/genesis.json`. This is a genesis file with the chain-id and genesis accounts balances.

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/poa-devnet/genesis.json ~/.exrpd/config/
    ```

    Verify the genesis configuration file:

    ```bash
    exrpd validate-genesis
    ```

2. Add Persistent Peer Nodes

    Set the [`persistent_peer`](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#persistent-peer)s field in `~/.exrpd/config/config.toml` to specify peers with which your node maintains persistent connections. You can retrieve them from the list of available peers on the archive repo ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/devnet/peers.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/devnet/peers.txt)).

    To get a list of entries from the `peers.txt` file in the `PEERS` variable, run the following command:

    ```bash
    PEERS=`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/poa-devnet/peers.txt | sort -R | head -n 10 | awk '{print $1}' | paste -s -d, -`
    ```

    Use `sed` to include them in the configuration. You can also add them manually:

    ```bash
    sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"/" ~/.exrpd/config/config.toml
    ```

## Start a Node

1. Start a node container.

    ```bash
    exrpd start
    ```

2. Provide Peersyst (<acarrera@peersyst.com>) with the key from this command:

    ```bash
    exrpd keys show <key_name> --keyring-backend=<keyring>
    ```
    
    **Note:** Peersyst provides your node with proof of authority to validate blocks on Devnet. This process takes 2-3 days.

## Run a Devnet Validator Node

**Warning:** Before creating a Devnet validator node, ensure that:
 - Peersyst provides your node with proof of authority.
 - You're running the node container.

Create a Devnet validator node with this command:

```bash
exrpd tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=1000000axrp \
  --pubkey=$(exrpd tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="<your_custom_moniker>" \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --commission-rate="0.05" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1000000" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-prices="0.025axrp" \
  --from=<key_name>
```

**Notes:**

- If you used a different keyring backend from the default `os`, you need to include this option:

    ```bash
    --keyring-backend=<keyring>
    ```

- When specifying commission parameters, the `commission-max-change-rate` is used to measure % *point* change over the `commission-rate`. For example, 1% to 2% is a 100% rate increase, but only 1 percentage point.

- `Min-self-delegation` is a strictly positive integer that represents the minimum amount of self-delegated voting power your validator must always have. A `min-self-delegation` of `1000000` means your validator will never have a self-delegation lower than `1 axrp`. <!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: will -->

Once enough voting power (+2/3) from the genesis validators is up-and-running, the node starts producing blocks.

# Manage the Validator Node

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

## Edit Validator Description

You can edit your validator's public description. This info identifies your validator, and _delegators_ use it when they decide to stake XRP tokens to a particular validator. Make sure to provide input for every flag below. If a flag is not included in the command, the field defaults to empty (`--moniker` defaults to the machine name), if the field has never been set, or remains the same, if it has been set in the past. <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: delegators --><!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: defaults to -->

The <key_name> specifies which validator you are editing. If you choose to not include certain flags, remember that the --from flag must be included to identify the validator to update.

The `--identity` can be used as to verify identity with systems like Keybase or UPort. When using with Keybase `--identity` must be populated with a 16-digit string that is generated with a [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) account. It is a cryptographically secure method of verifying your identity across multiple online networks. The Keybase API allows us to retrieve your Keybase avatar. This is how you can add a logo to your validator profile. <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: uport -->

```bash
exrpd tx staking edit-validator
  --moniker="<your_custom_moniker>" \
  --website="https://xrpl.org" \
  --identity=6A0D65E29A4CBC8E \
  --details="<your_validator_description>" \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-prices="0.025axrp" \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --commission-rate="0.10"
```

Note that the `commission-rate` value must adhere to the following invariants:

  * Must be between 0 and the validator's `commission-max-rate`
  * Must not exceed the validator's `commission-max-change-rate` which is the maximum % point change rate **per day**. In other words, a validator can only change its commission once per day and within `commission-max-change-rate` bounds.

## View Validator Description

View the validator's information with this command:

```bash
exrpd query staking validator <account>
```

## Track Validator Signing Information

To track a validator's signatures from past transactions use the `signing-info` command. 

```bash
exrpd query slashing signing-info <validator-pubkey> --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

## Unjail Validator
<!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: unjail -->

When a validator is "jailed" for downtime, you must submit an `Unjail` transaction from the operator account to restore block proposer awards (depending on the zone fee distribution).

```bash
exrpd tx slashing unjail --from=<key_name> --chain-id=<chain_id>
```

## Confirm Your Validator is Running

Your validator is active if the following command returns anything:

```bash
exrpd query tendermint-validator-set | grep "$(exrpd tendermint show-address)"
```

You should now see your validator in one of the Exrp explorers. You are looking for the `bech32` encoded `address` in the `~/.exprd/config/priv_validator.json` file. <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: exrp -->

**Note** To be in the validator set, you must have more total voting power than the 100th validator.

## Halting Your Validator

When attempting to perform routine maintenance or planning for an upcoming coordinated upgrade, it can be useful to have your validator systematically and gracefully halt. Set the `halt-height` to the height at which you want your node to shut down, or pass the `--halt-height` flag to `exrpd`. The node shuts down with a 0 exit code at that given height after committing the block.

    "chainId": "1440002",
    "nodes": 3,
    "extraAccounts": [],
    "safe": {
        "owners": [

| safe.quorum | number | Yes | The number of signatures required to run an operation in the safe. | `1` |

## Create the Blockchain

**Note:** By default, all node keys are created using the test keyring. If you want to deploy the network, you need to use the file keyring with a password to encrypt the node keys. Specify the `PASSWORD` env variable:

    ```bash
    export PASSWORD=mysupersecurepassword
    ```

Run the `blockchain create` command and specify where to export all the blockchain data.

```bash
evmcli blockchain create -c create-config.json -e $PWD/data
```

## Run the Network Locally

The `blockchain create` command creates a _docker-compose.yml_ file that you can use to run the network locally. Run this command inside your exported data folder:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

# Stress Test the Bridge

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

You can stress test account creations and claims.

## Create Account

```bash
evmcli bridge stress \
    --config ./usd-bridge.json \
    --parallel-creates 10 \
    --create-iterations 10 \
```

Each iteration will:

- Create a random account on the locking chain.
- Make an `XChainCreateAccountCommit` transaction on the issuing chain, using the previously created account.
- Wait for attestations to receive the funds on the locking chain.
- Repeat the process using the destination account as the origin account.

## Create Claims

```bash
evmcli bridge stress \
    --config ./usd-bridge.json \
    --parallel-claims 15 \
    --claim-iterations 5
```

Each iteration will:

- Make an `XChainCreateClaim` transaction on the locking chain.
- Make an `XChainCommit` transaction on the locking chain, using the previously created Claim ID.
- Wait for attestations to receive the funds on the locking chain.
- Repeat the process using the destination account as the origin account, and the origin account as the destination account.

You can stress test the blockchain using the `blockchain stress` command.

## Generate Wallets

Before you can stress test on the network, you need to create a set of wallets that hold XRP. These accounts are used by the stress script to create transactions in parallel and stress the blockchain.

### Set Up Redis

Redis is used by _[Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull)_ to manage queues that enable parallel and ordered processing of transactions.

Run this command:

```bash
docker run --name stress-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis redis-server --maxmemory 4G
```

**Note:** Modify the `--maxmemory` parameter for stress tests with large amounts of transactions.

### Create a Config File

Create a JSON config file in this format:

```json

# Witness Server Configuration

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

Before running a witness server, you must create a YAML configuration file. Some fields can be configured through environment variables; in the case of conficts, the environment variable is used instead of the YAML key.

| Key | Description | Example | ENV Key |
|-----|-------------|---------|---------|
| server | All the server generic configuration. | | |
| server.queue_period | The amount of seconds to wait before fetching for new events. | `5` | SERVER_QUEUE_PERIOD |
| server.logging_level | The log level of the server. Can be: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`. | `info` | SERVER_LOGGING_LEVEL |
| server.log_file_path | The file path to store the server logs. | `./logs/log.txt` | SERVER_LOG_FILE_PATH |
| server.validate_bridge | If the server must run a config validation before starting. | `true` | SERVER_VALIDATE_BRIDGE |
| xrp | XRPL side related configuration. | | |
| xrp.node | XRPL node to connect with. | `"wss://sidechain-net1.devnet.rippletest.net"` | XRP_NODE |
| xrp.bridge_address | The address of the bridge on the XRPL side. | `"rs99jCuSAjrXzdebKm1AgpErz9M2FwHQCE"` | XRP_BRIDGE_ADDRESS |
| xrp.starting_block | The block that the server will start listening for attestations. If not declared, server will start listening on the latest block. | `1` | XRP_STARTING_BLOCK |
| xrp.signer_list_seconds | The amount that pass before checking if the witness server is in the signer list. | `300` | XRP_SIGNER_LIST_SECONDS |
| xrp.signer | XRPL signer related configuration. | | |
| evm | EVM related configuration. | | |
| evm.node | EVM node to connect with. | `"https://rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org"` | EVM_NODE |
| evm.bridge_address | The address of the bridge on the EVM side. | `"0x4C5033DB823538d398e84Bf65fAdEbA0b4d71599"` | EVM_BRIDGE_ADDRESS |
| evm.starting_block | The block that the server will start listening for attestations. If not declared, server will start listening on the latest block. | `1` | EVM_STARTING_BLOCK |
| evm.signer_list_seconds | The amount that pass before checking if the witness server is in the signer list. | `300` | EVM_SIGNER_LIST_SECONDS |
| evm.signer | EVM signer related configuration. | | |

## Signer Types

In order to give the node operator flexibility, there are two types of signers that can be configured. Each one has different configuration options.

### Local Signer

This is the most simple signer. The witness operator holds the private key and configures the signer using these parameters:

| Key | Description | Example | ENV Key |
|-----|-------------|---------|---------|
| xrp.signer.type<br>evm.signer.type | To configure a local signer , this value must be `local`. | `"local"` | XRP_SIGNER_TYPE<br>EVM_SIGNER_TYPE |
| xrp.signer.spec<br>evm.signer.spec | Local signer related configuration. | | |
| xrp.signer.spec.private_key<br>evm.signer.spec.private_key | The private key of the local signer. If the local signer is on an XRPL chain, the private key must be in hexadecimal format. | `"****"` | XRP_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY<br>EVM_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY |

### AWS Signer

This signer type uses the AWS KMS systems to store its private key. The private key is under AWS custody and never leaves their system, making the signing process more secure. You can configure the witness server for AWS, using these parameters:

| Key | Description | Example | ENV Key |
|-----|-------------|---------|---------|
| xrp.signer.type<br>evm.signer.type | To configure an AWS signer, this value must be `aws`. | `"aws"` | |
| xrp.signer.type<br>evm.signer.type | AWS signer related configuration. | | |
| xrp.signer.spec.region<br>evm.signer.spec.region | The AWS region where the KMS key is stored. | `"eu-west-1"` | XRP_SIGNER_AWS_REGION<br>EVM_SIGNER_AWS_REGION |
| xrp.signer.spec.access_key<br>evm.signer.spec.access_key | An AWS access key with read access to the KMS key. | `"fake-access-key"` | AWS_ACCESS_KEY |
| xrp.signer.spec.secret_key<br>evm.signer.spec.secret_key | An AWS secret key with read access to the KMS key. | `"fake-secret-key"` | AWS_SECRET_KEY |
| xrp.signer.spec.key_id<br>evm.signer.spec.key_id | The AWS KMS key id. | `"fake-key-id"` | XRP_SIGNER_KMS_KEY_ID<br>EVM_SIGNER_KMS_KEY_ID |

## Example Configuration File

```yaml
server:
  queue_period: 5
  logging_level: info
  log_file_path: ./logs/log.txt

# Witness Servers

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

A witness server enables bridge operators to listen for transactions on the connected chains and sign attestations. _Attestations_ are used as proof that events on a chain occurred.

Running a witness server requires you to:

1. [Create a bridge door account](deploy-a-bridge.md) and be one of its witnesses or signer owners.
2. [Create a witness server YAML config file](witness-server-configuration.md).
3. [Build and run the witness server](build-and-run-witness-servers.md).

# XRPL EVM Sidechain FAQ

### Why are Ripple and Peersyst building an EVM sidechain?

The XRPL natively lacks the full programmability option to add custom business logic. The only programmabilIty option XRPL has today is a “smart transactor” but it's very difficult to write one and any significant change that affects existing protocol needs to go through the amendment process to be approved by the XRPL community. The Hooks feature developed by XRPL Labs promises to bring native programmability to the XRPL. EVM compatible blockchains have “smart contract” functionality that enables developers to build and deploy new applications without a network vote.

EVM compatibility on different blockchains:

| Blockchain Ecosystem | EVM Compatibility Solution/Project |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Ethereum             | Native                             |
| Solana               | Neon                               |
| Polkadot             | Moonbeam                           |
| Cosmos               | Evmos                              |
| Polygon              | zkEVM                              |
| BNB Chain            | BNB Smart Chain                    |
| Avalanche            | Avalance C-chain                   |
| **XRPL**             | **EVM Sidechain**                  |

An EVM sidechain will help the XRPL ecosystem attract EVM developers who can deploy their existing EVM applications on the EVM sidechain with minor modifications.

### What are the main benefits of the EVM sidechain?

The main benefits are:

- Faster time to launch by deploying applications as smart contracts.
- No amendment approval needed to launch applications.
- Make minor changes to existing smart contracts on other blockchains and launch them on the EVM sidechain.
- Grow the XRPL ecosystem by adding EVM ecosystem projects and developers.

### What are the main risks with the EVM sidechain?

With the XRPL, developers use existing primitives such as payments, DEX, escrow etc. which are secure and have a great track record. With EVM applications, the security is the responsibility of the smart contract developer. Smart contract bugs can get exploited and they have led to a loss of funds.

### What is the main use case for the EVM sidechain?

From an XRPL community perspective, the EVM sidechain enables EVM developers to launch their existing applications in the XRPL ecosystem. Developers can now write smart contracts and build applications, and not be constrained by the capabilities of XRPL smart transactors. XRPL developers can launch applications that previously required XRPL protocol change and an amendment proposal which is complex, resource intensive, and risky.

### How many EVM sidechains will there be? Can I set up my own?

There will be one public EVM sidechain supported by Ripple and Peersyst for the XRPL community. This EVM sidechain will have multiple validators run by XRPL community members. The software needed to run an EVM sidechain will be open source and any community member can use it to set up their own EVM sidechains, for permissioned use cases for example.

### What are any critical dependencies to the launch of the EVM sidechain?

The main dependency is that the amendment for cross-chain bridges (XLS-38d) proposal needs to be approved by the community and be live on the XRPL Mainnet. This is because the bridge between the XRPL and the EVM sidechain uses the XLS-38d bridge design.

### Who will run the XRPL - EVM sidechain bridge?

The bridge connecting the XRPL and the EVM sidechain will use the XLS-38d standard and will be operated by XRPL community members by running witness servers.

### What does success look like for the EVM sidechain after launch on XRPL Mainnet?

Long term, the EVM sidechain has a large and sustainable ecosystem of developers. The XRPL developer ecosystem has adopted the EVM sidechain as an extension of the XRPL and uses it as a testing ground before features are proposed on XRPL Mainnet or has deployed apps there that are not suitable for the XRPL Mainnet.

### Who is our target user for the EVM sidechain?

An EVM application developer who has experience writing Solidity applications and who is looking to monetize their applications on other EVM compatible blockchains outside of Ethereum. This developer isn’t happy about the high gas fees and low transaction speeds on Ethereum during peak usage.

Another segment of EVM developers is the EVM core developer that works on new protocol primitives on Ethereum or similar blockchains. They have less opportunities to contribute to Ethereum so the EVM sidechain provides them a blank slate to add new innovative capabilities.

### What consensus algorithm does the EVM sidechain use?

The EVM sidechain will use the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. A set of validators will confirm blocks on the EVM sidechain. New validators can join, or current validators can be updated or removed based on voting by the existing set of validators.

### Why should an EVM developer use the EVM sidechain of the XRPL as opposed to Ethereum or any other EVM compatible blockchain?

An EVM developer that builds on the EVM sidechain essentially gets a blank slate to start from. There will be considerable excitement to deploy the first apps that were successful on other EVM blockchains on the EVM sidechain. The EVM sidechain has a 3.5 second block time  which is much lower than the 12-15 seconds used on Ethereum. XRP is one of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, and developers can reach millions of XRP holders by launching dapps on the EVM sidechain where XRP is a native gas token.

### Are there any incentives for EVM sidechain validator nodes?

The EVM sidechain will not have any block rewards. The transaction fee for transactions confirmed on the EVM sidechain will be distributed to EVM sidechain validator nodes. This is unlike the XRPL where this transaction fee is burnt.

### What applications are recommended to be developed on XRPL vs EVM sidechain?

Developers are free to choose any blockchain they wish. The XRPL has a robust set of native primitives that are secure, performant and with low transaction cost. Developers can build using these primitives natively on the XRPL.

On the other hand, the XRPL has limited programmability options for developers to change business logic in the primitives that exist. The ability to readily deploy programmable applications, combined with ample XRP liquidity from XRPL Mainnet and 3.5 second block times, makes the EVM sidechain especially optimized for DeFi use cases.

### How does the EVM sidechain compare to Hooks and the Xahau sidechain?

We see Hooks and EVM sidechain as two complementary efforts to bring more programmability to the XRPL ecosystem. These target two different types of developers.

- **Native XRPL Developer:** A developer who wants to build new features or add new logic to XRPL protocol that is not currently available on XRPL Mainnet. They are interested in developing natively on the XRPL and the Hooks and Xahau Sidechain allows them to do that. If and when the Hooks feature is live on the XRPL Mainnet, they can use Hooks on the XRPL Mainnet.
- **EVM Developer:** A developer looking to build new applications or deploy their existing EVM applications on the EVM sidechain to leverage the benefits of the XRPL ecosystem. They don’t want to learn a new way to build applications on the XRPL. They like the programmability that the EVM provides and want to maximize their revenue opportunities by deploying their dapps on an EVM compatible blockchain.

# Open Source Projects

Ripple contributes to the maintenance and development of the open source XRP Ledger. The XRP Ledger is a decentralized public blockchain and Ripple collaborates with the wider XRP Ledger community to develop new features and capabilities for the XRP Ledger.

This site provides information on open source projects that Ripple engineers are working on, including in-progress documentation for features that are in development. 

While Ripple may be the primary developer on these open source projects, it is not a centralized authority (there isn't one) and  there is no central actor. Community contributions and feedback are welcome!

Proposals for new features and amendments go through the consensus process for review and approval by the XRP Ledger community before they can be merge into the XRP Ledger code base. Once a feature is merged on the `master` branch of the `rippled` codebase, documentation for that feature will be available on [xrpl.org](https://xrpl.org).

To learn more about the consensus process and the workflow for features to go from an idea to activation on the XRP Ledger, see <https://xrpl.org/amendments.html>.

# Automated Market Maker 

An automated market maker (AMM) is a protocol for the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that prices assets through an algorithm, rather than using an order book like a traditional exchange.

AMMs allow you to trade at a certain exchange rate on a DEX without having to find a counterparty. Instead of having to find a neighbor who is willing to trade USD for Euro, or go to the airport currency exchange counter, the AMM allows you to exchange tokens freely.

AMMs allow people to trade tokens peer-to-peer through liquidity pools, which are token reserves secured by a smart contract. The more tokens available to trade, the lower the exchange fee to swap between the tokens.

To learn more about AMMs, see [Automated Market Makers](automated-market-makers.md).

# Automated Market Makers

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are smart contracts that provide liquidity in the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange. Each AMM holds a pool of two assets and enables users to swap between them at an exchange rate set by a formula.

For any given pair of assets, there can be up to one AMM in the ledger. Anyone can create the AMM for an asset pair if it doesn't exist yet, or deposit to an existing AMM. Those who deposit assets into an AMM are called _liquidity providers_ (LPs) and receive "LP Tokens" from the AMM. LP Tokens enable liquidity providers to:

- Redeem their LP Tokens for a share of the assets in the AMM's pool, including fees collected.
- Vote to change the AMM's fee settings. The votes are weighted based on how many LP Tokens the voters hold.
- Bid some of their LP Tokens to receive a temporary discount on the AMM's trading fees.

When the flow of funds between the two assets in a pool is relatively active and balanced, the fees provide a source of passive income for liquidity providers. However, when the relative price between the assets shifts, the liquidity providers can take a loss on the [currency risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyrisk.asp).

## How the AMM Works

An AMM holds two different assets: at most one of these can be XRP, and one or both of them can be [tokens](https://xrpl.org/tokens.html). Tokens with different issuers are considered different assets for this purpose. This means that there can be an AMM for two tokens with the same currency code but different issuers ("FOO issued by WayGate" is different than "FOO issued by StableFoo"), or the same issuer but different currency codes. The order does not matter; the AMM for FOO.WayGate to XRP is the same as for XRP to FOO.WayGate.

When users want to trade in the decentralized exchange, their [Offers](https://xrpl.org/offers.html) and [Cross-Currency Payments](https://xrpl.org/cross-currency-payments.html) can automatically use AMMs to complete the trade. A single transaction might execute by matching Offers, AMMs, or a mix of both, depending on what's cheaper.

An AMM sets its exchange rate based on the balance of assets in the pool. When you trade against an AMM, the exchange rate adjusts based on how much your trade shifts the balance of assets the AMM holds. As its supply of one asset goes down, the price of that asset goes up; as its supply of an asset goes up, the price of that asset goes down. An AMM gives generally better exchange rates when it has larger overall amounts in its pool. This is because any given trade causes a smaller shift in the balance of the AMM's assets. The more a trade unbalances the AMM's supply of the two assets, the more extreme the exchange rate becomes.

The AMM also charges a percentage trading fee on top of the exchange rate.

The XRP Ledger's implements a _geometric mean_ AMM with a weight parameter of 0.5, so it functions like a _constant product_ market maker. For a detailed explanation of the _constant product_ AMM formula and the economics of AMMs in general, see [Kris Machowski's Introduction to Automated Market Makers](https://www.machow.ski/posts/an_introduction_to_automated_market_makers/).

## LP Tokens
<!-- TODO: add diagrams showcasing flow of funds -->
Whoever creates the AMM becomes the first liquidity provider, and receives LP Tokens that represent 100% ownership of assets in the AMM's pool. They can redeem some or all of those LP Tokens to withdraw assets from the AMM in proportion to the amounts currently there. (The proportions shift over time as people trade against the AMM.) The AMM does not charge a fee when withdrawing both assets.

For example, if you created an AMM with 5 ETH and 5 USD, and then someone exchanged 1.26 USD for 1 ETH, the pool now has 4 ETH and 6.26 USD in it. You can spend half your LP Tokens to withdraw 2 ETH and 3.13 USD.

Anyone can deposit assets to an existing AMM. When they do, they receive new LP Tokens based on how much they deposited. The amount that a liquidity provider can withdraw from an AMM is based on the proportion of the AMM's LP Tokens they hold compared to the total number of LP Tokens outstanding.

LP Tokens are like other tokens in the XRP Ledger, so you can use them in many [types of payments](https://xrpl.org/payment-types.html), trade them in the decentralized exchange, or even deposit them as assets for new AMMs. (To receive LP Tokens as payment, you must set up a [trust line](https://xrpl.org/trust-lines-and-issuing.html) with a nonzero limit with the AMM Account as the issuer.) However, you can _only_ send LP Tokens directly to the AMM (redeeming them) using the `AMMWithdraw` transaction type, not through other types of payments. Similarly, you can only send assets to the AMM's pool through the `AMMDeposit` transaction type.

The AMM is designed so that an AMM's asset pool is empty if and only if the AMM has no outstanding LP Tokens. This situation can only occur as the result of an `AMMWithdraw` transaction; when it does, the AMM is automatically deleted.

### LP Token Currency Codes

LP Tokens use a special type of currency code in the 160-bit hexadecimal ["non-standard" format](https://xrpl.org/currency-formats.html#nonstandard-currency-codes). These codes have the first 8 bits `0x03`. The remainder of the code is a SHA-512 hash, truncated to the first 152 bits, of the two assets' currency codes and their issuers. (The assets are placed in a "canonical order" with the numerically lower currency+issuer pair first.) As a result, the LP Tokens for a given asset pair's AMM have a predictable, consistent currency code.

## Trading Fees

Trading fees are a source of passive income for liquidity providers, and they offset the currency risk of letting others trade against the pool's assets. Trading fees are paid to the AMM, not directly to liquidity providers, but liquidity providers benefit because their LP Tokens can be redeemed for a percentage of the AMM's pool.

Liquidity providers can vote to set the fee from 0% to 1%, in increments of 0.001%. Liquidity providers have an incentive to set trading fees at an appropriate rate: if fees are too high, trades will use order books to get a better rate instead; if fees are too low, liquidity providers don't get any benefit for contributing to the pool. <!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: will --> Each AMM gives its liquidity providers the power to vote on its fees, in proportion to the amount of LP Tokens those liquidity providers hold.

To vote, a liquidity provider sends an `AMMVote` transaction. Whenever anyone places a new vote, the AMM recalculates its fee to be an average of the latest votes weighted by how many LP Tokens those voters hold. Up to 8 liquidity providers' votes can be counted this way; if more liquidity providers try to vote then only the top 8 votes (by most LP Tokens held) are counted. Even though liquidity providers' share of LP Tokens can shift rapidly for many reasons (such as trading those tokens using [Offers](https://xrpl.org/offers.html)), the trading fees are only recalculated whenever someone places a new vote (even if that vote is not one of the top 8).

### Auction Slot

Unlike any previous Automated Market Makers, the XRP Ledger's AMM design has an _auction slot_ that a liquidity provider can bid on to get a discount on the trading fee for a 24-hour period. The bid must be paid in LP Tokens, which are returned to the AMM. No more than one account can hold the auction slot at a time, but the bidder can name up to 4 more accounts to also receive the discount. There is no minimum bid, but if the slot is currently occupied then you must outbid the current slot holder to displace them. If someone displaces you, you get part of your bid back depending on how much time remains. As long as you hold an active auction slot, you pay a discounted trading fee of 0% when making trades against that AMM.

With any AMM, when the price of its assets shifts significantly in external markets, traders can use arbitrage to profit off the AMM, which results in a loss for liquidity providers. The auction mechanism is intended to return more of that value to liquidity providers and more quickly bring the AMM's prices back into balance with external markets.

## Representation in the Ledger

In the ledger's state data, an AMM consists of multiple [ledger entries](https://xrpl.org/ledger-object-types.html):

- An `AMM` entry describing the automated market maker itself.

- A special `AccountRoot` entry that issues the AMM's LP Tokens, and holds the AMM's XRP (if it has any).
    
    The address of this AccountRoot is chosen somewhat randomly when the AMM is created, and it is different if the AMM is deleted and re-created. This is to prevent people from funding the AMM account with excess XRP in advance.

- [Trust lines](https://xrpl.org/trust-lines-and-issuing.html) to the special AMM Account for the tokens in the AMM's pool.

These ledger entries are not owned by any account, so the [reserve requirement](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html) does not apply to them. However, to prevent spam, the transaction to create an AMM has a special [transaction cost](https://xrpl.org/transaction-cost.html) that requires the sender to burn a larger than usual amount of XRP.

## Deletion

An AMM is deleted when an [AMMWithdraw transaction](./transaction-types/ammwithdraw.md) withdraws all assets from its pool. This only happens by redeeming all of the AMM's outstanding LP Tokens. Deleting the AMM removes all the ledger entries associated with it, such as:

- `AMM`
- `AccountRoot`
- Trust lines for the AMM's LP Tokens. These trust lines would have a balance of 0 but may have other details, such as the limit, set to a non-default value.

If there are more than 512 trust lines attached to the AMM account when it would be deleted, the withdraw succeeds and deletes as many trust lines as it can, but leaves the AMM in the ledger with no assets in its pool.

While an AMM has no assets in its pool, anyone can delete it by sending an [AMMDelete transaction](./transaction-types/ammdelete.md); if the remaining number of trust lines is still greater than the limit, multiple AMMDelete transactions may be necessary to fully delete the AMM. Alternatively, anyone can perform a [special deposit](./transaction-types/ammdeposit.md#empty-amm-special-case) to fund the AMM as if it were new. No other operations are valid on an AMM with an empty asset pool.

There is no refund or incentive for deleting an empty AMM.

# AccountRoot

The XLS-30d proposal includes some changes to the existing [AccountRoot ledger entry type](https://xrpl.org/accountroot.html).

## AccountRoot Fields

There is a new field:

| Field            | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description  |
|:-----------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|--------------|
| `AMMID`          | String              | Hash256           | No        | The ledger entry ID of the corresponding AMM ledger entry. Set during account creation; cannot be modified. If present, indicates that this is a special AMM AccountRoot; always omitted on non-AMM accounts. |

## Special AMM AccountRoot Objects

Automated Market Makers use an AccountRoot ledger entry to issue their LP Tokens and hold the assets in the AMM pool, and an [AMM ledger entry](amm.md) for tracking some of the details of the AMM. The address of an AMM's AccountRoot is randomized so that users cannot identify and fund the address in advance of the AMM being created. Unlike normal accounts, AMM AccountRoot objects are created with the following settings:

- `lsfDisableMaster` **enabled** and no means of authorizing transactions. This ensures no one can control the account directly, and it cannot send transactions.
- `lsfDepositAuth` **enabled** and no accounts preauthorized. This ensures that the only way to add money to the AMM Account is using the [AMMDeposit transaction](../transaction-types/ammdeposit.md).
- `lsfDefaultRipple` **enabled**. This ensures that users can send and trade the AMM's LP Tokens among themselves.

In addition, the following special rules apply to an AMM's AccountRoot entry:

- It is not subject to the [reserve requirement](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html). It can hold XRP only if XRP is one of the two assets in the AMM's pool.
- It cannot be the destination of Checks, Escrows, or Payment Channels. Any transactions that would create such entries instead fail with the result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`.
- Users cannot create trust lines to it for anything other than the AMM's LP Tokens. Transactions that would create such trust lines instead fail with result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`. (The AMM does have two trust lines to hold the tokens in its pool, or one trust line if the other asset in its pool is XRP.)
- If [Clawback (XLS-39d)](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/blob/master/XLS-39d-clawback/README.md) is also enabled, the issuer cannot clawback funds from an AMM.

Other than those exceptions, these accounts are like ordinary accounts; the LP Tokens they issue behave like other [tokens](https://xrpl.org/tokens.html) except that those tokens can also be used in AMM-related transactions. You can check an AMM's balances and the history of transactions that affected it the same way you would with a regular account.

# AMM
[[Source]](https://github.com/gregtatcam/rippled/blob/c1e4bfb08bcc9f187d794a71d653003a6148dc68/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L265-L275 "Source")
<!-- TODO: Update source link to merged version when available -->

The `AMM` object type describes a single [Automated Market Maker](../automated-market-makers.md) (AMM) instance.

## Example AMM JSON

## AMM Fields

The `AMM` object has the following fields:

| Field            | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description  |
|:-----------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|--------------|
| `Asset`          | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for one of the two assets this AMM holds. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields. |
| `Asset2`         | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for the other asset this AMM holds. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields. |
| `AMMAccount`     | String              | AccountID         | Yes       | The address of the [special account](https://xrpl.org/accountroot.html#special-amm-accountroot-objects) that holds this AMM's assets. |
| `AuctionSlot`    | Object              | STObject          | No        | Details of the current owner of the auction slot, as an [Auction Slot object](#auction-slot-object). |
| `LPTokenBalance` | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | Yes       | The total outstanding balance of liquidity provider tokens from this AMM instance. The holders of these tokens can vote on the AMM's trading fee in proportion to their holdings, or redeem the tokens for a share of the AMM's assets which grows with the trading fees collected. |
| `TradingFee`     | Number              | UInt16            | Yes       | The percentage fee to be charged for trades against this AMM instance, in units of 1/100,000. The maximum value is 1000, for a 1% fee. |
| `VoteSlots`      | Array               | STArray           | No        | A list of vote objects, representing votes on the pool's trading fee. |

### Auction Slot Object

The `AuctionSlot` field contains an object with the following nested fields:

| Field           | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:----------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|:--|
| `Account`       | String - Address    | AccountID         | Yes       | The current owner of this auction slot. |
| `AuthAccounts`  | Array               | STArray           | No        | A list of at most 4 additional accounts that are authorized to trade at the discounted fee for this AMM instance. |
| `DiscountedFee` | String              | UInt32            | Yes       | The trading fee to be charged to the auction owner, in the same format as `TradingFee`. By default this is 0, meaning that the auction owner can trade at no fee instead of the standard fee for this AMM. |
| `Price`         | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | Yes       | The amount the auction owner paid to win this slot, in LP Tokens. |
| `Expiration`    | String              | UInt32            | Yes       | The time when this slot expires, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][]. |

## VoteEntry Object

The `VoteSlots` field contains an array of `VoteEntry` objects with the following fields:

| Field            | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description  |
|:-----------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|--------------|
| `Account`        | String - Address    | AccountID         | Yes       | The account that cast the vote. |
| `TradingFee`     | Number              | UInt16            | Yes       | The proposed trading fee, in units of 1/100,000; a value of 1 is equivalent to 0.001%. The maximum value is 1000, indicating a 1% fee. |
| `VoteWeight`     | Number              | UInt32            | Yes       | The weight of the vote, in units of 1/100,000. For example, a value of 1234 means this vote counts as 1.234% of the weighted total vote. The weight is determined by the percentage of this AMM's LP Tokens the account owns. The maximum value is 100000. |

## AMM Flags

There are currently no flags defined for `AMM` objects.

## AMM ID Format

The ID of an `AMM` object is the [SHA-512Half][] of the following values, concatenated in order:

1. The `AMM` space key (`0x0041`)
0. The AccountID of the first asset's issuer.
0. The 160-bit currency code of the first token.
0. The AccountID of the second asset's issuer.
0. The 160-bit currency code of the second token.

For XRP, use all 0's for both the token and the issuer.

| `validated`            | Boolean          | If `true`, the ledger used for this request is validated and these results are final; if omitted or set to `false`, the data is pending and may change. |

### AMM Description Object

The `amm` field is an object describing the current status of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) in the ledger, and contains the following fields:

| Field           | Type                | Description |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `amm_account`   | String              | The [Address](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#addresses) of the AMM Account. |
| `amount`        | [Currency Amount](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#specifying-currency-amounts) | The total amount of one asset in the AMM's pool. (Note: This could be `asset` _or_ `asset2` from the request.) |
| `amount2`       | [Currency Amount](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#specifying-currency-amounts) | The total amount of the other asset in the AMM's pool. (Note: This could be `asset` _or_ `asset2` from the request.) |

| `asset2_frozen` | Boolean             | _(Omitted for XRP)_ If `true`, the `amount2` currency is currently [frozen](https://xrpl.org/freezes.html). |
| `auction_slot`  | Object              | _(May be omitted)_ An [Auction Slot Object](#auction-slot-object) describing the current auction slot holder, if there is one. |
| `lp_token`      | [Currency Amount](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#specifying-currency-amounts) | The total amount of this AMM's LP Tokens outstanding. |
| `trading_fee`   | Number              | The AMM's current trading fee, in units of 1/100,000; a value of 1 is equivalent to a 0.001% fee. |
| `vote_slots`    | Array               | _(May be omitted)_ The current votes for the AMM's trading fee, as [Vote Slot Objects](#vote-slot-objects). |

### Auction Slot Object

The `auction_slot` field of the `amm` object describes the current auction slot holder of the AMM, and contains the following fields:

| Field            | Type                | Description |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `account`        | String              | The [Address](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#addresses) of the account that owns the auction slot. |
| `auth_accounts`  | Array               | A list of additional accounts that the auction slot holder has designated as being eligible of the discounted trading fee. Each member of this array is an object with one field, `account`, containing the address of the designated account. |
| `discounted_fee` | Number              | The discounted trading fee that applies to the auction slot holder, and any eligible accounts, when trading against this AMM. This is always 0. |
| `expiration`     | String              | The ISO 8601 UTC timestamp after which this auction slot expires. After expired, the auction slot does not apply (but the data can remain in the ledger until another transaction replaces it or cleans it up). |
| `price`          | [Currency Amount](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#specifying-currency-amounts) | The amount, in LP Tokens, that the auction slot holder paid to win the auction slot. This affects the price to outbid the current slot holder. |
| `time_interval`  | Number              | The current 72-minute time interval this auction slot is in, from 0 to 19. The auction slot expires after 24 hours (20 intervals of 72 minutes) and affects the cost to outbid the current holder and how much the current holder is refunded if someone outbids them. |

### Vote Slot Objects

Each entry in the `vote_slots` array represents one liquidity provider's vote to set the trading fee, and contains the following fields:

| Field         | Type   | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| `account`     | String | The [Address](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#addresses) of this liquidity provider. |
| `trading_fee` | Number | The trading fee this liquidity provider voted for, in units of 1/100,000. |
| `vote_weight` | Number | How much this liquidity provider's vote counts towards the final trading fee. This is proportional to how much of the AMM's LP Tokens this liquidity provider holds. The value is equal to 100,000 times the number of this LP Tokens this liquidity provider holds, divided by the total number of LP Tokens outstanding. For example, a value of 1000 means that the liquidity provider holds 1% of this AMM's LP Tokens. |

### Possible Errors

- Any of the [universal error types](https://xrpl.org/error-formatting.html#universal-errors).
- `actNotFound` - The AMM for this asset pair does not exist, or an issuing account specified in the request does not exist.
- `invalidParams` - One or more fields are specified incorrectly, or one or more required fields are missing.

# ledger_entry

XLS-30d extends the existing [ledger_entry method](https://xrpl.org/ledger_entry.html) so that it can be used to retrieve an AMM object.

### Get AMM Object

Retrieve an Automated Market-Maker (AMM) object from the ledger. This is similar to [amm_info method](amm_info.md), but the `ledger_entry` version returns only the ledger entry as stored.

| Field        | Type             | Description           |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| `amm`        | Object or String | The [AMM](../ledger-object-types/amm.md) to retrieve. If you specify a string, it must be the [object ID](https://xrpl.org/ledger-object-ids.html) of the AMM, as hexadecimal. If you specify an object, it must contain `asset` and `asset2` sub-fields. |
| `amm.asset`  | Object           | One of the two assets in this AMM's pool, as a [currency object without an amount](https://xrpl.org/currency-formats.htcurrency-formats.html#specifying-without-amounts). |
| `amm.asset2` | Object           | The other of the two assets in this AMM's pool, as a [currency object without an amount](https://xrpl.org/currency-formats.htcurrency-formats.html#specifying-without-amounts). |

# AMM Transaction Result Codes

XLS-30d adds new result codes for transactions. (AMM-related transactions also reuse some existing result codes where appropriate.)

## ter Codes

| Code             | Explanation                                               |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| `terNO_AMM`      | The AMM-related transaction specifies an asset pair that does not currently have an AMM instance. |

## tec Codes

| Code                     | Value | Explanation                             |
|:-------------------------|:------|:----------------------------------------|
| `tecAMM_ACCOUNT`         | 168   | The transaction failed because the operation is not allowed on Automated Market Maker (AMM) accounts. |
| `tecAMM_UNFUNDED`        | 162   | The [AMMCreate transaction](../transaction-types/ammcreate.md) failed because the sender does not have enough of the specified assets to fund it. |
| `tecAMM_BALANCE`         | 163   | The [AMMDeposit](../transaction-types/ammdeposit.md) or [AMMWithdraw](../transaction-types/ammwithdraw.md) failed because either the AMM or the user does not hold enough of one of the specified assets. (For example, you tried to withdraw more than the AMM holds.) |
| `tecAMM_EMPTY`           | 166   | The AMM-related transaction failed because the AMM has no assets in its pool. In this state, you can only delete the AMM or fund it with a new deposit. |
| `tecAMM_FAILED`          | 164   | The AMM-related transaction failed. For an [AMMDeposit](../transaction-types/ammdeposit.md) or [AMMWithdraw](../transaction-types/ammwithdraw.md) this could be because the sender does not have enough of the specified assets, or the transaction requested an effective price that isn't possible with the available amounts. For [AMMBid](../transaction-types/ammbid.md) this could be because the account does not have enough to win the bid or needs more than their specified maximum bid. For [AMMVote](../transaction-types/ammvote.md), this could be because there are already too many votes from other accounts that hold more of this AMM's LP Tokens. |
| `tecAMM_INVALID_TOKENS`  | 165   | The AMM-related transaction failed due to insufficient LP Tokens or problems with rounding; for example, depositing a very small amount of assets could fail if the amount of LP Tokens to be returned rounds down to zero. |
| `tecAMM_NOT_EMPTY`       | 167   | The transaction was meant to operate on an AMM with empty asset pools, but the specified AMM currently holds assets. |

## tem Codes

| Code                | Explanation                                   |
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `temBAD_AMM_TOKENS` | The transaction incorrectly specified one or more assets. For example, the asset's issuer does not match the corresponding asset in the AMM's pool, or the transaction specified the same asset twice. |

# AMMBid
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/src/ripple/app/tx/impl/AMMBid.cpp "Source")

<embed src="/snippets/_amm-disclaimer.md" />

Bid on an [Automated Market Maker](../automated-market-makers.md)'s (AMM's) auction slot. If you win, you can trade against the AMM at a discounted fee until you are outbid or 24 hours have passed. If you are outbid before 24 hours have passed, you are refunded part of the cost of your bid based on how much time remains.

You bid using the AMM's LP Tokens; the amount of a winning bid is returned to the AMM, decreasing the outstanding balance of LP Tokens.

In addition to the common fields, AMMBid transactions use the following fields:

| Field          | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:---------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Asset`        | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for one of the assets in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `Asset2`       | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for the other asset in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `BidMin`       | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | Pay at least this amount for the slot. Setting this value higher makes it harder for others to outbid you. If omitted, pay the minimum necessary to win the bid. |
| `BidMax`       | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | Pay at most this amount for the slot. If the cost to win the bid is higher than this amount, the transaction fails. If omitted, pay as much as necessary to win the bid. |
| `AuthAccounts` | Array               | STArray           | No        | A list of up to 4 additional accounts that you allow to trade at the discounted fee. This cannot include the address of the transaction sender. Each of these objects should be an [Auth Account object](#auth-account-objects). |

### Auth Account Objects

Each member of the `AuthAccounts` array must be an object with the following field:

| Field          | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:---------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Account`      | String    | AccountID         | Yes       | The address of the account to authorize. |

Like other "inner objects" that can appear in arrays, the JSON representation of each of these objects is wrapped in an object whose only key is the object type, `AuthAccount`.

## Auction Slot Price

If successful, the transaction automatically outbids the previous slot owner and debits the bid price from the sender's LP Tokens. The price to win the auction decreases over time, divided into 20 intervals of 72 minutes each. If the sender does not have enough LP Tokens to win the bid, or the price of the bid is higher than the transaction's `BidMax` value, the transaction fails with a `tecAMM_FAILED_BID` result.

- If the auction slot is currently empty, expired, or in its last interval, the **minimum bid** is **0.001% of the AMM's total LP Tokens balance**.

    **Caution:** This minimum value is a placeholder and may change before the AMM feature becomes finalized.

- Otherwise, the price to outbid the current holder is calculated using the following formula:

        P = B × 1.05 × (1 - t⁶⁰) + M

    - `P` is the price to outbid, in LP Tokens.
    - `B` is the price of the current bid, in LP Tokens.
    - `t` is the fraction of time elapsed in the current 24-hour slot, rounded down to a multiple of 0.05.
    - `M` is the **minimum bid** as defined above.

    There are two special cases for the cost to outbid someone. In the **first interval** after someone wins the bid, the price to outbid them is the minimum bid plus 5% more than the existing bid:

        P = B × 1.05 + M

    In the **last interval** of someone's slot, the cost to outbid someone is only the minimum bid:

        P = M

**Note:** To make sure all servers in the network reach the same results when building a ledger, time measurements are based on the [official close time](https://xrpl.org/ledgers.html#ledger-close-times) of the previous ledger, which is approximate.

## Bid Refunds

When you outbid an active auction slot, the AMM refunds the previous holder part of the price, using this formula:

```text
R = B × (1 - t)
```

- `R` is the amount to refund, in LP Tokens.
- `B` is the price of the previous bid to be refunded, in LP Tokens.
- `t` is the fraction of time elapsed in the current 24-hour slot, rounded down to a multiple of 0.05.

As a special case, during the final (20th) interval of the auction slot, the refunded amount is zero.

**Note:** As with all XRP Ledger times, transaction processing uses the [official close time](https://xrpl.org/ledgers.html#ledger-close-times) of the _previous_ ledger, which can result in a difference of up to about 10 seconds from real time.

## AMM Cases previous holder
Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, AMMBid transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](https://xrpl.org/transaction-results.html):

| Error Code              | Description                                  |

| `tecAMM_EMPTY`          | The AMM has no assets in its pool. In this state, you can only delete the AMM or fund it with a new deposit. |
| `tecAMM_FAILED`         | This transaction could not win the auction, either because the sender does not hold enough LP Tokens to pay the necessary bid or because the price to win the auction was higher than the transaction's specified `BidMax` value. |
| `tecAMM_INVALID_TOKENS` | The sender of this transaction does not hold enough LP Tokens to meet the slot price. |
| `temBAD_AMM_TOKENS`     | The specified `BidMin` or `BidMax` were not specified as the correct LP Tokens for this AMM. |

# AMMCreate
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/src/ripple/app/tx/impl/AMMCreate.cpp "Source")

<embed src="/snippets/_amm-disclaimer.md" />

Create a new [Automated Market Maker](../automated-market-makers.md) (AMM) instance for trading a pair of assets ([fungible tokens](https://xrpl.org/tokens.html) or [XRP](https://xrpl.org/xrp.html)).

Creates both an [AMM object](../ledger-object-types/amm.md) and a [special AccountRoot object](https://xrpl.org/accountroot.html#special-amm-accountroot-objects) to represent the AMM. Also transfers ownership of the starting balance of both assets from the sender to the created `AccountRoot` and issues an initial balance of liquidity provider tokens (LP Tokens) from the AMM account to the sender.

**Caution:** When you create the AMM, you should fund it with (approximately) equal-value amounts of each asset. Otherwise, other users can profit at your expense by trading with this AMM ([performing arbitrage](https://www.machow.ski/posts/an_introduction_to_automated_market_makers/#price-arbitrage)). The currency risk that liquidity providers take on increases with the volatility (potential for imbalance) of the asset pair. The higher the trading fee, the more it offsets this risk, so it's best to set the trading fee based on the volatility of the asset pair.

## Example AMMCreate JSON

```json
{
    "Account" : "rJVUeRqDFNs2xqA7ncVE6ZoAhPUoaJJSQm",
    "Amount" : {
        "currency" : "TST",
        "issuer" : "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd",
        "value" : "25"
    },
    "Amount2" : "250000000",
    "Fee" : "2000000",
    "Flags" : 2147483648,
    "Sequence" : 6,
    "TradingFee" : 500,
    "TransactionType" : "AMMCreate"
}
```

In addition to the common fields, AMMCreate transactions use the following fields:

| Field        | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Amount`     | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | Yes       | The first of the two assets to fund this AMM with. This must be a positive amount. |
| `Amount2`    | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | Yes       | The second of the two assets to fund this AMM with. This must be a positive amount. |
| `TradingFee` | Number              | UInt16            | Yes       | The fee to charge for trades against this AMM instance, in units of 1/100,000; a value of 1 is equivalent to 0.001%. The maximum value is `1000`, indicating a 1% fee. The minimum value is `0`. |

One or both of `Amount` and `Amount2` can be [tokens](https://xrpl.org/tokens.html); at most one of them can be [XRP](https://xrpl.org/xrp.html). They cannot both have the same currency code and issuer. The tokens' issuers must have [Default Ripple](https://xrpl.org/rippling.html#the-default-ripple-flag) enabled. If the Clawback amendment is enabled, those issuers must not have the ability to clawback their tokens. An AMM's LP tokens _can_ be used as one of the assets for another AMM.

## Special Transaction Cost

Since each AMM instance involves an AccountRoot ledger entry, an AMM ledger entry, and a trust line for each token in its pool, an AMMCreate transaction requires a much higher than usual [transaction cost](https://xrpl.org/transaction-cost.html) to deter ledger spam. Instead of the standard minimum of 0.00001 XRP, AMMCreate must destroy at least the incremental owner reserve amount, currently 2 XRP. This is the same special transaction cost as AccountDelete transactions.

## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, AMMCreate transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](https://xrpl.org/transaction-results.html):

| Error Code          | Description                                  |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `tecAMM_INVALID_TOKENS` | Either `Amount` or `Amount2` has a currency code that is the same as this AMM's LP Tokens would use. (This is very unlikely to occur.) |
| `tecDUPLICATE`      | There is already another AMM for this currency pair. |
| `tecFROZEN`         | At least one of the deposit assets (`Amount` or `Amount2`) is currently [frozen](https://xrpl.org/freezes.html). |
| `tecINSUF_RESERVE_LINE` | The sender of this transaction does meet the increased [reserve requirement](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html) of processing this transaction, probably because they need a new trust line to hold the LP Tokens, and they don't have enough XRP to meet the additional owner reserve for a new trust line. |
| `tecNO_AUTH`        | At least one of the deposit assets uses [authorized trust lines](https://xrpl.org/authorized-trust-lines.html) and the sender does not have authorization to hold that asset. |
| `tecNO_LINE`        | The sender does not have a trust line for at least one of the deposit assets. |
| `tecNO_PERMISSION`  | At least one of the deposit assets cannot be used in an AMM. For example, the issuer has enabled Clawback support. |
| `tecUNFUNDED_AMM`   | The sender does not hold enough of the assets specified in `Amount` and `Amount2` to fund the AMM. |
| `terNO_RIPPLE`      | The issuer of at least one of the assets has not enabled the [Default Ripple flag](https://xrpl.org/rippling.html#the-default-ripple-flag). |
| `temAMM_BAD_TOKENS` | The values of `Amount` and `Amount2` are not valid: for example, both refer to the same token. |
| `temBAD_FEE`        | The `TradingFee` value is invalid. It must be zero or a positive integer and cannot be over 1000. |
| `temDISABLED`       | The AMM feature is not enabled on this network. |

# AMMDelete
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/src/ripple/app/tx/impl/AMMDelete.cpp "Source")

<embed src="/snippets/_amm-disclaimer.md" />

Delete an empty [Automated Market Maker](../automated-market-makers.md) (AMM) instance that could not be fully deleted automatically.

Normally, an [AMMWithdraw transaction](./ammwithdraw.md) automatically deletes an AMM and all associated ledger entries when it withdraws all the assets from the AMM's pool. However, if there are too many trust lines to the AMM account to remove in one transaction, it may stop before fully removing the AMM. Similarly, an AMMDelete transaction removes up to a maximum of 512 trust lines; it may take several AMMDelete transactions to delete all the trust lines and the associated AMM. In all cases, only the last such transaction deletes the AMM and AccountRoot ledger entries.

## Example AMMDelete JSON

```json
{
    "Account" : "rJVUeRqDFNs2xqA7ncVE6ZoAhPUoaJJSQm",
    "Asset" : {

In addition to the common fields, AMMDeposit transactions use the following fields:

| Field         | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:--------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Asset`       | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for one of the assets in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `Asset2`      | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for the other asset in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `Amount`      | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | The amount of one asset to deposit to the AMM. If present, this must match the type of one of the assets (tokens or XRP) in the AMM's pool. |
| `Amount2`     | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | The amount of another asset to add to the AMM. If present, this must match the type of the other asset in the AMM's pool and cannot be the same asset as `Amount`. |
| `EPrice`      | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | The maximum effective price, in the deposit asset, to pay for each LP Token received. |
| `LPTokenOut`  | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | How many of the AMM's LP Tokens to buy. |

### AMMDeposit Modes

This transaction has five modes, defined by which flag you specify. Each mode expects a specific combination of fields. The modes fall into two categories:

- **Double-asset deposits**, in which you provide both assets in the AMM's pool, proportional to the balance of the assets already there. These deposits are not subject to a fee.
- **Single-asset deposits**, in which you provide only one of the AMM's two assets. The AMM charges a fee, debited from the LP Tokens paid out, based on how much your deposit shifts the balance of assets in the pool.

The following combinations of fields indicate a **double-asset deposit**:

| Flag Name    | Flag Value   | Fields Specified       | Meaning |
|--------------|--------------|------------------------|---------|
| `tfLPToken`  | `0x00010000` | `LPTokenOut` only      | Deposit both of this AMM's assets, in amounts calculated so that you receive the specified amount of LP Tokens in return. The amounts deposited maintain the relative proportions of the two assets the AMM already holds. |
| `tfTwoAsset` | `0x00100000` | `Amount` and `Amount2` | Deposit both of this AMM's assets, up to the specified amounts. The actual amounts deposited must maintain the same balance of assets as the AMM already holds, so the amount of either one deposited MAY be less than specified. The amount of LP Tokens you get in return is based on the total value deposited. |
| `tfTwoAssetIfEmpty` | `0x00800000` | `Amount` and `Amount2` | Deposit both of this AMM's assets, in exactly the specified amounts, to an AMM with an empty asset pool. The amount of LP Tokens you get in return is based on the total value deposited. |

The following combinations of fields indicate a **single asset deposit**:

| Flag Name           | Flag Value   | Fields Specified           | Meaning |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------|
| `tfSingleAsset`     | `0x00080000` | `Amount` only              | Deposit exactly the specified amount of one asset, and receive an amount of LP Tokens based on the resulting share of the pool (minus fees). |
| `tfOneAssetLPToken` | `0x00200000` | `Amount` and `LPTokenOut`  | Deposit up to the specified amount of one asset, so that you receive exactly the specified amount of LP Tokens in return (after fees). |
| `tfLimitLPToken`    | `0x00400000` | `Amount` and `EPrice`      | Deposit up to the specified amount of one asset, but pay no more than the specified effective price per LP Token (after fees). |

Any other combination of these fields and flags is invalid.

### Single Asset Deposit Fee

 The fee for a single asset deposit is calculated to be the same as if you had used the AMM to trade part of the deposit amount for the other asset, then done a double-asset deposit. The AMM's trading fee applies to the amount you would need to trade for, but not to the rest of the deposit. _For example, if the AMM's asset pool is split perfectly evenly between USD and EUR, and you try to deposit 100 USD, the amount of LP Tokens you receive is slightly less than if you had deposited 50 EUR + 50 USD, because you pay the trading fee to convert some of your USD to an equal amount of EUR._

 The formula for how many LP Tokens you receive for a double-asset deposit is:

{{ include_svg("img/amm-single-asset-deposit-formula.svg", "L = T × ( (( 1 + (B - (F × (1 - W) × B)) ÷ P)^W) - 1)") }}
<!-- TODO: improve graphic -->

Where:

- `L` is the amount of LP Tokens returned
- `T` is the total outstanding LP Tokens before the deposit
- `B` is the amount of the asset being deposited
- `F` is the trading fee, as a decimal
- `W` is the weight of the deposit asset in the pool. This is defined as 0.5 for all AMM pools (meaning a 50/50 split), so exponentiation by W is equivalent to taking the square root.
- `P` is the total amount of the deposit asset in the pool before the deposit

### Empty AMM Special Case

In some cases, an AMM can exist with no assets in its pool. You cannot perform normal deposits into an AMM in such a state because the ratio between the assets is undefined (0/0). Instead, you can use a special "Empty AMM" deposit case with the flag `tfTwoAssetIfEmpty` and exact amounts of both assets. This directly sets the ratio between the assets in the same way an [AMMCreate transaction](./ammcreate.md) does when an AMM is initially created. Like a double-asset deposit, this is not subject to a fee.

You can only do a special "Empty AMM" deposit if the AMM is empty.

### AMMDeposit Flags

Transactions of the AMMDeposit type support additional values in the [`Flags` field](https://xrpl.org/transaction-common-fields.html#flags-field), as follows:

| Flag Name           | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Description           |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:----------------------|
| `tfLPToken`         | `0x00010000` | 65536         | Perform a double-asset deposit and receive the specified amount of LP Tokens. |
| `tfSingleAsset`     | `0x00080000` | 524288        | Perform a single-asset deposit with a specified amount of the asset to deposit. |
| `tfTwoAsset`        | `0x00100000` | 1048576       | Perform a double-asset deposit with specified amounts of both assets. |
| `tfOneAssetLPToken` | `0x00200000` | 2097152       | Perform a single-asset deposit and receive the specified amount of LP Tokens. |
| `tfLimitLPToken`    | `0x00400000` | 4194304       | Perform a single-asset deposit with a specified effective price. |
| `tfTwoAssetIfEmpty` | `0x00800000` | 8388608       | Perform a special double-asset deposit to an AMM with an empty pool. |

You must specify **exactly one** of these flags, plus any [global flags](https://xrpl.org/transaction-common-fields.html#global-flags).

## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, AMMDeposit transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](https://xrpl.org/transaction-results.html):

| Error Code              | Description                                  |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `tecAMM_EMPTY`          | The AMM currently holds no assets, so you cannot do a normal deposit. You must use the Empty AMM Special Case deposit instead. |
| `tecAMM_NOT_EMPTY`      | The transaction specified `tfTwoAssetIfEmpty`, but the AMM was not empty. |
| `tecAMM_FAILED`         | The conditions on the deposit could not be satisfied. For example, the requested effective price in the `EPrice` field is too low. |
| `tecFROZEN`             | The transaction tried to deposit a [frozen](https://xrpl.org/freezes.html) token. |
| `tecINSUF_RESERVE_LINE` | The sender of this transaction does meet the increased [reserve requirement](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html) of processing this transaction, probably because they need a new trust line to hold the LP Tokens, and they don't have enough XRP to meet the additional owner reserve for a new trust line. |
| `tecUNFUNDED_AMM`       | The sender does not have a high enough balance to make the specified deposit. |
| `temBAD_AMM_TOKENS`     | The transaction specified the LP Tokens incorrectly. For example, the `issuer` is not the AMM's associated AccountRoot address or the `currency` is not the currency code for this AMM's LP Tokens, or the transaction specified this AMM's LP Tokens in one of the asset fields. |
| `temBAD_AMOUNT`         | An amount specified in the transaction is invalid. For example, a deposit amount is negative. |
| `temBAD_FEE`            | A fee value specified in the transaction is invalid. For example, the trading fee is outside the allowable range. |
| `temMALFORMED`          | The transaction specified an invalid combination of fields. See [AMMDeposit Modes](#ammdeposit-modes). |
| `terNO_ACCOUNT`         | An account specified in the request does not exist. |
| `terNO_AMM`             | The Automated Market Maker instance for the asset pair in this transaction does not exist. |

# AMMVote
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/src/ripple/app/tx/impl/AMMVote.cpp "Source")

<embed src="/snippets/_amm-disclaimer.md" />

Vote on the trading fee for an [Automated Market Maker](../automated-market-makers.md) instance. Up to 8 accounts can vote in proportion to the amount of the AMM's LP Tokens they hold. Each new vote re-calculates the AMM's trading fee based on a weighted average of the votes.

## Example AMMVote JSON

```json
{
    "Account" : "rJVUeRqDFNs2xqA7ncVE6ZoAhPUoaJJSQm",
    "Asset" : {
        "currency" : "XRP"
    },
    "Asset2" : {
        "currency" : "TST",
        "issuer" : "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd"
    },
    "Fee" : "10",
    "Flags" : 2147483648,
    "Sequence" : 8,
    "TradingFee" : 600,
    "TransactionType" : "AMMVote"
}
```

In addition to the common fields, AMMVote transactions use the following fields:

| Field        | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Asset`      | Object    | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for one of the assets in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `Asset2`     | Object    | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for the other asset in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `TradingFee` | Number    | UInt16            | Yes       | The proposed fee to vote for, in units of 1/100,000; a value of 1 is equivalent to 0.001%. The maximum value is 1000, indicating a 1% fee. |

## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, AMMVote transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](https://xrpl.org/transaction-results.html):

| Error Code              | Description                                  |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `tecAMM_EMPTY`          | The AMM has no assets in its pool. In this state, you can only delete the AMM or fund it with a new deposit. |
| `tecAMM_INVALID_TOKENS` | The sender cannot vote because they do not hold any of this AMM's LP Tokens. |
| `tecAMM_FAILED_VOTE`    | There are already 8 votes from accounts that hold more LP Tokens than the sender of this transaction. |
| `temBAD_FEE`            | The `TradingFee` from this transaction is not valid. |
| `terNO_AMM`             | The Automated Market Maker instance for the asset pair in this transaction does not exist. |

# AMMWithdraw
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/src/ripple/app/tx/impl/AMMWithdraw.cpp "Source")

<embed src="/snippets/_amm-disclaimer.md" />

Withdraw assets from an [Automated Market Maker](../automated-market-makers.md) (AMM) instance by returning the AMM's liquidity provider tokens (LP Tokens).

## Example AMMWithdraw JSON

```json
{
    "Account" : "rJVUeRqDFNs2xqA7ncVE6ZoAhPUoaJJSQm",
    "Amount" : {
        "currency" : "TST",
        "issuer" : "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd",
        "value" : "5"
    },
    "Amount2" : "50000000",
    "Asset" : {
        "currency" : "TST",
        "issuer" : "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd"
    },
    "Asset2" : {
        "currency" : "XRP"
    },
    "Fee" : "10",
    "Flags" : 1048576,
    "Sequence" : 10,
    "TransactionType" : "AMMWithdraw"
}
```

In addition to the common fields, AMMWithdraw transactions use the following fields:

| Field        | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Asset`      | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for one of the assets in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `Asset2`     | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for the other asset in the AMM's pool. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields (omit `issuer` for XRP). |
| `Amount`     | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | The amount of one asset to withdraw from the AMM. This must match the type of one of the assets (tokens or XRP) in the AMM's pool. |
| `Amount2`    | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | The amount of another asset to withdraw from the AMM. If present, this must match the type of the other asset in the AMM's pool and cannot be the same type as `Amount`. |
| `EPrice`     | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | The minimum effective price, in LP Token returned, to pay per unit of the asset to withdraw. |
| `LPTokenIn`  | [Currency Amount][] | Amount            | No        | How many of the AMM's LP Tokens to redeem. |

**Note:** For a two-asset withdrawal, it is possible for `Asset` to correspond to _either_ `Amount` or `Amount2` as long as `Asset2` corresponds to the other one. It is recommended to match them (that is, `Amount2` is an amount of the asset defined in `Asset2`) because it is less confusing that way.

### AMMWithdraw Modes

This transaction has several modes, depending on which flags you specify. Each mode expects a specific combination of fields. The modes fall into two categories:

- **Double-asset withdrawals**, in which you receive both assets from the AMM's pool in proportions that match their balances there. These withdrawals are not subject to a fee.
- **Single-asset withdrawals**, in which you receive one asset from the AMM's pool. The AMM charges a fee based on how much your withdrawal shifts the balance of assets in the pool. Depending on the withdraw mode, the amount of the fee can be added to the amount of LP Tokens paid in, or debited from the amount of the asset paid out.

The following modes are for a **double-asset withdrawal**:

| Flag Name(s)    | Flag Value   | Fields Specified       | Meaning |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------------|---------|
| `tfLPToken`     | `0x00010000` | `LPTokenIn` only      | Return the specified amount of LP Tokens and receive both assets from the AMM's pool in amounts based on the returned LP Tokens' share of the total LP Tokens issued. |
| `tfWithdrawAll` | `0x00020000` | No Fields              | Return _all_ of your LP Tokens and receive as much as you can of both assets in the AMM's pool. |
| `tfTwoAsset`    | `0x00100000` | `Amount` and `Amount2` | Withdraw both of this AMM's assets, in up to the specified amounts. The actual amounts received maintains the balance of assets in the AMM's pool. |

The following combinations of fields indicate a **single asset withdrawal**:

| Flag Name(s)            | Flag Value   | Fields Specified         | Meaning |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------|
| `tfSingleAsset`         | `0x00080000` | `Amount` only            | Withdraw exactly the specified amount of one asset, by returning as many LP Tokens as necessary. |
| `tfOneAssetWithdrawAll` | `0x00040000` | `Amount` only            | Withdraw at least the specified amount of one asset, by returning _all_ of your LP Tokens. Fails if you can't receive at least the specified amount. The specified amount can be 0, meaning the transaction succeeds if it withdraws any positive amount. |
| `tfOneAssetLPToken`     | `0x00200000` | `Amount` and `LPTokenIn` | Withdraw up to the specified amount of one asset, by returning up to the specified amount of LP Tokens. |
| `tfLimitLPToken`        | `0x00400000` | `Amount` and `EPrice`    | Withdraw up to the specified amount of one asset, but pay no more than the specified effective price in LP Tokens per unit of the asset received. |

Any other combination of these fields is invalid.

### Single Asset Withdrawal Fee

The fee for a single asset withdrawal is calculated to be the same as if you had done a double-asset withdrawal and then used the AMM to trade all of the other asset for the one you are withdrawing. The trading fee applies to the amount you would need to trade for, but not to the rest of the withdrawal.

<!-- TODO: add a formula and example calculation(s) of single-asset withdrawal fees -->

### AMM Deletion

If the transaction withdraws the last of the AMM's assets, it automatically tries to delete the AMM along with all associated trust lines. However, there is a limit to how many empty trust lines can be removed in one transaction. If too many empty trust lines exist, the AMM remains in the ledger in an empty state; it can be deleted with further [`AMMDelete` transactions](./ammdelete.md), or it can be refilled with a special "empty AMM" two-asset [`AMMDeposit` transaction](./ammdeposit.md). While an AMM is empty, no other operations on it are valid.

### AMMWithdraw Flags

Transactions of the AMMWithdraw type support additional values in the [`Flags` field](https://xrpl.org/transaction-common-fields.html#flags-field), as follows:

| Flag Name               | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Description           |
|:------------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:----------------------|
| `tfLPToken`             | `0x00010000` | 65536         | Perform a double-asset withdrawal and receive the specified amount of LP Tokens. |
| `tfWithdrawAll`         | `0x00020000` | 131072        | Perform a double-asset withdrawal returning all your LP Tokens. |
| `tfOneAssetWithdrawAll` | `0x00040000` | 262144        | Perform a single-asset withdrawal returning all of your LP Tokens. |
| `tfSingleAsset`         | `0x00080000` | 524288        | Perform a single-asset withdrawal with a specified amount of the asset to withdrawal. |
| `tfTwoAsset`            | `0x00100000` | 1048576       | Perform a double-asset withdrawal with specified amounts of both assets. |
| `tfOneAssetLPToken`     | `0x00200000` | 2097152       | Perform a single-asset withdrawal and receive the specified amount of LP Tokens. |
| `tfLimitLPToken`        | `0x00400000` | 4194304       | Perform a single-asset withdrawal with a specified effective price. |

You must specify **exactly one** of these flags, plus any [global flags](https://xrpl.org/transaction-common-fields.html#global-flags).

## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, {{currentpage.name}} transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](https://xrpl.org/transaction-results.html):

| Error Code              | Description                                  |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `tecAMM_EMPTY`          | The AMM has no assets in its pool. In this state, you can only delete the AMM or fund it with a new deposit. |
| `tecAMM_BALANCE`        | The transaction would withdraw all of one asset from the pool, or rounding would cause a "withdraw all" to leave a nonzero amount behind. |
| `tecAMM_FAILED`         | The conditions on the withdrawal could not be satisfied; for example, the requested effective price in the `EPrice` field is too low. |
| `tecAMM_INVALID_TOKENS` | The AMM for this token pair does not exist, or one of the calculations resulted in a withdrawal amount rounding to zero. |
| `tecFROZEN`             | The transaction tried to withdraw a [frozen](https://xrpl.org/freezes.html) token. |
| `tecINSUF_RESERVE_LINE` | The sender of this transaction does not meet the increased [reserve requirement](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html) of processing this transaction, probably because they need at least one new trust line to hold one of the assets to be withdrawn, and they don't have enough XRP to meet the additional owner reserve for a new trust line. |
| `tecNO_AUTH`            | The sender is not authorized to hold one of the AMM assets. |
| `temMALFORMED`          | The transaction specified an invalid combination of fields. See [AMMWithdraw Modes](#ammwithdraw-modes). (This error can also occur if the transaction is malformed in other ways.) |
| `temBAD_AMM_TOKENS`     | The transaction specified the LP Tokens incorrectly; for example, the `issuer` is not the AMM's associated AccountRoot address or the `currency` is not the currency code for this AMM's LP Tokens, or the transaction specified this AMM's LP Tokens in one of the asset fields.  |
| `terNO_AMM`             | The Automated Market Maker instance for the asset pair in this transaction does not exist. |

# Create an Automated Market Maker

An [Automated Market Maker (AMM)](../automated-market-makers.md) can be an efficient way to facilitate exchanges between two assets, while earning its liquidity providers passive income. This tutorial shows how to create the AMM for a given asset pair.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an XRP Ledger address and some XRP. For testing, you can get these from a [Faucet](https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html).
- You should be familiar with the Getting Started instructions for your preferred client library. This page provides examples for the following:
    - **JavaScript** with the [xrpl.js library](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js/) **version 2.8.0-beta.0 or later**. See [Get Started Using JavaScript](https://xrpl.org/get-started-using-javascript.html) for setup steps.
    - You can also use [an interactive version of this tutorial in your browser](https://mduo13.github.io/xrpl-dev-portal/pr-preview/amm/create-an-automated-market-maker.html).
- You should have a basic understanding of how [tokens](https://xrpl.org/tokens.html) work in the XRP Ledger.
- You may want to read about [Automated Market Makers in the XRP Ledger](../automated-market-makers.md) first.

## Example Code

Complete sample code for all of the steps of these tutorials is available under the MIT license.

- See [Code Samples: Create an AMM](https://github.com/ripple/opensource.ripple.com/tree/main/docs/xls-30d-amm/code-samples/create-amm) in the source repository for this website.

## Steps

### 1. Connect to the network

You must be connected to the network to query it and submit transactions. The following code shows how to connect to a public server using a supported [client library](https://xrpl.org/client-libraries.html):

```js JavaScript
// In browsers, use a <script> tag. In Node.js, uncomment the following line:
// const xrpl = require('xrpl')

const WS_URL = 'wss://amm.devnet.rippletest.net:51233/'
const EXPLORER = 'amm-devnet.xrpl.org' // Optional, for linking

async function main() {
  // Define the network client
  const client = new xrpl.Client(WS_URL)
  await client.connect()

  // ... custom code goes here

  // Disconnect when done (If you omit this, Node.js won't end the process)
  await client.disconnect()
}

main()
```

### 2. Get credentials

To transact on the XRP Ledger, you need an address and secret key, and some XRP. For development purposes, you can get these from the [Faucet](https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html).

When you're [building production-ready software](https://xrpl.org/production-readiness.html), you should use an existing account, and manage your keys using a [secure signing configuration](https://xrpl.org/set-up-secure-signing.html). The following code shows how to get a `Wallet` instance using either the faucet or a seed provided by environment variable:

```js JavaScript
// Get credentials from the Faucet -------------------------------------------
  console.log("Requesting address from the faucet...")
  const wallet = (await client.fundWallet()).wallet

  // To use an existing account, use code such as the following:
  // const wallet = xrpl.Wallet.fromSeed(process.env['USE_SEED'])
```

### 3. Select and acquire assets

As the creator of an AMM, you are also the first liquidity provider and you have to supply it with a starting pool of assets. Other users of the XRP Ledger can also become liquidity providers by supplying assets after the AMM exists. It's important to choose assets especially carefully because, as a liquidity provider for an AMM, you are supplying some amounts of both for users to swap between. If one of the AMM's assets becomes worthless, other users can use the AMM to trade for the other asset, leaving the AMM (and thus, its liquidity providers including you) holding only the worthless one. Technically, the AMM always holds some positive amount of both assets, but the amounts can be very small.

You can choose any pair of fungible assets in the XRP Ledger, including XRP or tokens, including LP Tokens from another AMM. If you use a token, you must hold some amount of that token. (If a token's issuer uses, [authorized trust lines](https://xrpl.org/authorized-trust-lines.html), that means you have to be authorized first.)

For each of the two assets, you need to know its currency code and issuer; as an exception, XRP has no issuer. For each of the assets, you must hold a balance of the asset (or _be_ the issuer). The following sample code acquires two assets, "TST" (which it buys using XRP) and "FOO" (which it receives from the issuer).

```js JavaScript
// Acquire tokens ------------------------------------------------------------
  const offer_result = await client.submitAndWait({
    "TransactionType": "OfferCreate",
    "Account": wallet.address,
    "TakerPays": {
      currency: "TST",
      issuer: "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd",
      value: "25"
    },
    "TakerGets": xrpl.xrpToDrops(25*10*1.16)
  }, {autofill: true, wallet: wallet})
  if (offer_result.result.meta.TransactionResult == "tesSUCCESS") {
    console.log(`TST offer placed: ${EXPLORER}/transactions/${offer_result.result.hash}`)
    const balance_changes = xrpl.getBalanceChanges(offer_result.result.meta)
    for (const bc of balance_changes) {
      if (bc.account != wallet.address) {continue}
      for (const bal of bc.balances) {
        if (bal.currency == "TST") {
          console.log(`Got ${bal.value} ${bal.currency}.${bal.issuer}.`)
          break
        }
      }
      break
    }

  } else {
    throw `Error sending transaction: ${offer_result}`
  }
  // Successfully placing the offer doesn't necessarily mean that you have TST,
  // but for now, let's assume it matched existing Offers on ledger so you do.

  // Call helper function to set up a new "FOO" issuer, create a trust line to them, 
  // and receive 1000 FOO from them.
  const foo_amount = await get_new_token(client, wallet, "FOO", "1000")
```

This tutorial includes some example code to issue FOO tokens from a second test address. This is not realistic for a production scenario, because tokens do not inherently have value, but it makes it possible to demonstrate creating a new AMM for a unique currency pair. In production, you would acquire a second token in some other way, such as making an off-ledger deposit with the [stablecoin issuer](https://xrpl.org/become-an-xrp-ledger-gateway.html), or buying it in the [decentralized exchange](https://xrpl.org/decentralized-exchange.html).

The helper function for issuing follows an abbreviated version of the steps in the [Issue a Fungible Token](https://xrpl.org/issue-a-fungible-token.html) tutorial:

```js JavaScript
/* Issue tokens ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fund a new issuer using the faucet, and issue some fungible tokens 
 * to the specified address. In production, you would not do this; instead,
 * you would acquire tokens from an existing issuer (for example, you might 
 * buy them in the DEX, or make an off-ledger deposit at a stablecoin issuer).
 * For a more thorough explanation of this process, see
 * "Issue a Fungible Token": https://xrpl.org/issue-a-fungible-token.html
 * Params:
 * client: an xrpl.Client instance that is already connected to the network
 * wallet: an xrpl.Wallet instance that should hold the new tokens
 * currency_code: string currency code (3-char ISO-like or hex code)
 * issue_quantity: string number of tokens to issue. Arbitrarily capped 
 *                 at "10000000000"
 * Resolves to: an "Amount"-type JSON object, such as:
 * {
 *   "currency": "TST",
 *   "issuer": "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd",
 *   "value": "123.456"
 * }
 */
async function get_new_token(client, wallet, currency_code, issue_quantity) {
  // Get credentials from the Testnet Faucet -----------------------------------
  console.log("Funding an issuer address with the faucet...")
  const issuer = (await client.fundWallet()).wallet
  console.log(`Got issuer address ${issuer.address}.`)

  // Enable issuer DefaultRipple ----------------------------------------------
  const issuer_setup_result = await client.submitAndWait({
    "TransactionType": "AccountSet",
    "Account": issuer.address,
    "SetFlag": xrpl.AccountSetAsfFlags.asfDefaultRipple
  }, {autofill: true, wallet: issuer} )
  if (issuer_setup_result.result.meta.TransactionResult == "tesSUCCESS") {
    console.log(`Issuer DefaultRipple enabled: ${EXPLORER}/transactions/${issuer_setup_result.result.hash}`)
  } else {
    throw `Error sending transaction: ${issuer_setup_result}`
  }

  // Create trust line to issuer ----------------------------------------------
  const trust_result = await client.submitAndWait({
    "TransactionType": "TrustSet",
    "Account": wallet.address,
    "LimitAmount": {
      "currency": currency_code,
      "issuer": issuer.address,
      "value": "10000000000" // Large limit, arbitrarily chosen
    }
  }, {autofill: true, wallet: wallet})
  if (trust_result.result.meta.TransactionResult == "tesSUCCESS") {
    console.log(`Trust line created: ${EXPLORER}/transactions/${trust_result.result.hash}`)
  } else {
    throw `Error sending transaction: ${trust_result}`
  }

  // Issue tokens -------------------------------------------------------------
  const issue_result = await client.submitAndWait({
    "TransactionType": "Payment",
    "Account": issuer.address,
    "Amount": {
      "currency": currency_code,
      "value": issue_quantity,
      "issuer": issuer.address
    },
    "Destination": wallet.address
  }, {autofill: true, wallet: issuer})
  if (issue_result.result.meta.TransactionResult == "tesSUCCESS") {
    console.log(`Tokens issued: ${EXPLORER}/transactions/${issue_result.result.hash}`)
  } else {
    throw `Error sending transaction: ${issue_result}`
  }

  return {
    "currency": currency_code,
    "value": issue_quantity,
    "issuer": issuer.address
  }
}
```

### 4. Check if the AMM exists

Since there can only be one AMM for a specific pair of assets, it's best to check first before trying to create one. Use the [amm_info method](../public-api-methods/amm_info.md) to see if the AMM already exists. For the request, you specify the two assets. The response should be an `actNotFound` error if the AMM does not exist.

```js JavaScript
// Check if AMM already exists ----------------------------------------------
  const amm_info_request = {
    "command": "amm_info", 
    "asset": {
      "currency": "TST",
      "issuer": "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd",
    },
    "asset2": {
      "currency": foo_amount.currency,
      "issuer": foo_amount.issuer
    },
    "ledger_index": "validated"
  }
  try {
    const amm_info_result = await client.request(amm_info_request)
    console.log(amm_info_result)
  } catch(err) {
    if (err.data.error === 'actNotFound') {
      console.log(`No AMM exists yet for the pair 
                   ${foo_amount.currency}.${foo_amount.issuer} / 
                   TST.rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd.
                   (This is probably as expected.)`)
    } else {
      throw(err)
    }
  }
```

If the AMM does already exist, you should double-check that you specified the right pair of assets; if so, someone else has already created this AMM, but you can still deposit to it instead. <!-- TODO: link to a tutorial about depositing to and withdrawing from an AMM when one exists -->

### 5. Look up the AMMCreate transaction cost

Creating an AMM has a special [transaction cost][] to prevent spam: since it creates objects in the ledger that no one owns, you must burn at least one [owner reserve increment](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html) of XRP to send the AMMCreate transaction. The exact value can change due to [fee voting](https://xrpl.org/fee-voting.html), so you should look up the current incremental reserve value using the [server_state method][].

It is also a good practice to display this value and give a human operator a chance to stop before you send the transaction. Burning an owner reserve is typically a much higher cost than sending a normal transaction, so you don't want it to be a surprise. (Currently, on both Mainnet and AMM-Devnet, the cost of sending a typical transaction is 0.000010 XRP but the cost of AMMCreate is 2 XRP.)

```js
// Look up AMM transaction cost. --------------------------------------------
  // AMMCreate requires burning one owner reserve. We can look up that amount
  // (in drops) on the current network using server_state:
  const ss = await client.request({"command": "server_state"})
  const amm_fee_drops = ss.result.state.validated_ledger.reserve_inc.toString()
  console.log(`Current AMMCreate transaction cost: 
               ${xrpl.dropsToXrp(amm_fee_drops)} XRP`)
```

### 6. Send AMMCreate transaction

Send an [AMMCreate transaction](../transaction-types/ammcreate.md) to create the AMM. Important aspects of this transaction include:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `Asset` | [Currency Amount][] | Starting amount of one asset to deposit in the AMM. |
| `Asset2` | [Currency Amount][] | Starting amount of the other asset to deposit in the AMM. |
| `TradingFee` | Number | The fee to charge when trading against this AMM instance. The maximum value is `1000`, meaning a 1% fee; the minimum value is `0`. If you set this too high, it may be too expensive for users to trade against the AMM; but the lower you set it, the more you expose yourself to currency risk from the AMM's assets changing in value relative to one another. |
| `Fee` | String - XRP Amount | The transaction cost you looked up in the previous step. Client libraries may require that you add a special exception or reconfigure a setting to specify a `Fee` value this high. |

For the two starting assets, it does not matter which is `Asset` and which is `Asset2`, but you should specify amounts that are about equal in total value, because otherwise other users can profit at your expense by trading against the AMM.

**Tip:** Use `fail_hard` when submitting this transaction, so you don't have to pay the high transaction cost if the transaction initially fails. (It's still _possible_ that the transaction could tentatively succeed, and then fail and still burn the transaction cost, but this protects you from burning XRP on many of types of failures.)

```js JavaScript
// Create AMM ---------------------------------------------------------------
  // This example assumes that 15 TST ≈ 100 FOO in value.
  const ammcreate_result = await client.submitAndWait({
    "TransactionType": "AMMCreate",
    "Account": wallet.address,
    "Amount": {
      currency: "TST",
      issuer: "rP9jPyP5kyvFRb6ZiRghAGw5u8SGAmU4bd",
      value: "15"
    },
    "Amount2": {
      "currency": foo_amount.currency,
      "issuer": foo_amount.issuer,
      "value": "100"
    },
    "TradingFee": 500, // 0.5%
    "Fee": amm_fee_drops
  }, {autofill: true, wallet: wallet, fail_hard: true})
  // Use fail_hard so you don't waste the tx cost if you mess up
  if (ammcreate_result.result.meta.TransactionResult == "tesSUCCESS") {
    console.log(`AMM created: ${EXPLORER}/transactions/${ammcreate_result.result.hash}`)
  } else {
    throw `Error sending transaction: ${ammcreate_result}`
  }
```

### 7. Check AMM info

If the AMMCreate transaction succeeded, it creates the AMM and related objects in the ledger. You _could_ check the metadata of the AMMCreate transaction, but it is often easier to call the [amm_info method](../public-api-methods/amm_info.md) again to get the status of the newly-created AMM. 

```js JavaScript
// Confirm that AMM exists --------------------------------------------------
  // Make the same amm_info request as earlier, but this time it should succeed
  const amm_info_result2 = await client.request(amm_info_request)
  console.log(amm_info_result2)
  const lp_token = amm_info_result2.result.amm.lp_token
  const amount = amm_info_result2.result.amm.amount
  const amount2 = amm_info_result2.result.amm.amount2
  console.log(`The AMM account ${lp_token.issuer} has ${lp_token.value} total
               LP tokens outstanding, and uses the currency code ${lp_token.currency}.`)
  console.log(`In its pool, the AMM holds ${amount.value} ${amount.currency}.${amount.issuer}
               and ${amount2.value} ${amount2.currency}.${amount2.issuer}`)
```

In the result, the `amm` object's `lp_token` field is particularly useful because it includes the issuer and currency code of the AMM's LP Tokens, which you need to know for many other AMM-related transactions. LP Tokens always have a hex currency code starting with `03`, and the rest of the code is derived from the issuers and currency codes of the tokens in the AMM's pool. The issuer of the LP Tokens is the AMM address, which is randomly chosen when you create an AMM.

Initially, the AMM's total outstanding LP Tokens, reported in the `lp_token` field of the `amm_info` response, match the tokens you hold as its first liquidity provider. However, after other accounts deposit liquidity to the same AMM, the amount shown in `amm_info` updates to reflect the total issued to all liquidity providers. Since others can deposit at any time, even potentially in the same ledger version where the AMM was created, you shouldn't assume that this amount represents your personal LP Tokens balance.

###  8. Check trust lines

You can also use the [account_lines method][] to get an updated view of your token balances. Your balances should be decreased by the amounts you deposited, but you now have a balance of LP Tokens that you received from the AMM.

```js JavaScript
// Check token balances
  const account_lines_result = await client.request({
    "command": "account_lines",
    "account": wallet.address,
    // Tip: To look up only the new AMM's LP Tokens, uncomment:
    // "peer": lp_token.issuer,
    "ledger_index": "validated"
  })
  console.log(account_lines_result)
```

The `account_lines` response shows only the tokens held by the account you looked up (probably yours). If you have a lot of tokens, you may want to specify the AMM address as the `peer` in the request so you don't have to [paginate](https://xrpl.org/markers-and-pagination.html) over multiple requests to find the AMM's LP Tokens. In this tutorial, your account probably only holds the three different tokens, so you can see all three in the same response.

**Tip:** If one of the assets in the AMM's pool is XRP, you need to call the [account_info method][] on your account to see the difference in your balance (the `Balance` field of the account object).

## Next Steps

At this point the AMM is up and running, and [trades in the DEX](https://xrpl.org/trade-in-the-decentralized-exchange.html) automatically use this AMM in combination with Offers to achieve the best exchange rate possible between the two assets in the AMM's pool. If the flow of funds between the two assets is relatively balanced and there are no major shifts in the value of one asset compared to the other, this can become a source of passive income for you and anyone else who deposits liquidity into the AMM's pool.

When you want to withdraw liquidity from the AMM, you can use [AMMDeposit](../transaction-types/ammdeposit.md) to cash in your LP Tokens to receive a share of the AMM's assets. You can also use LP Tokens like any other tokens in the XRP Ledger, which means you can trade them, use them in payments, or even deposit them in another AMM.

However, you should keep an eye on market conditions, and use tools like [AMMBid](../transaction-types/ammbid.md) and [AMMVote](../transaction-types/ammvote.md) to insulate yourself from losses due to changes in the relative value of the two assets in the pool.

# Cross-Chain Bridges

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

Cross-chain bridges for the XRP Ledger enable value in the form of XRP and other tokens (IOUs) to move efficiently between blockchains such as the XRP Ledger and its [sidechains](xrpl-sidechains.md).

A locking chain is a blockchain that holds assets that are then put into trust when a bridge to an issuing chain is created.

An issuing chain is an independent ledger with its own consensus algorithm and transaction types and rules. It acts as its own blockchain.

Both the locking and issuing chains operate as parallel networks with independent nodes and validators. They rely on independent [witness servers](witness-server.md) to watch transactions between the two chains and attest that assets have moved into specifically designated accounts.

## Terminology

- **Bridge**: A method of moving assets/value from one blockchain to another.

- **Locking Chain**: The chain on which the bridge locks and unlocks assets.

- **Issuing Chain**: The chain on which the bridge mints and burns assets.

- **Witness**: Independent servers that are aware of the locking and issuing chains. See [witness servers](witness-server.md) for more information.

- **Attestation**: A message signed by a witness server, verifying a transaction occurred on a chain. There are attestations for `XChainCommit` and `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transactions.

- **Cross-chain transfer**: A transfer of assets from one chain to another.

- **Source chain**: The chain that a cross-chain transfer begins from. The transfer is from the source chain and to the destination chain.

- **Destination chain**: The chain that a cross-chain transfer ends at. The transfer is from the source chain and to the destination chain.

- **Door account**: A special type of account that is used to move assets from one chain to another. The door account on a locking chain is used to put assets into trust, and the door account on an issuing chain used to issue wrapped assets. 

- **Cross-chain claim ID**: A special identifier used for cross-chain transfers. A cross-chain claim ID represents *one* cross-chain transfer of value.

## How Do Cross-Chain Transactions Work?
 
At a high-level, cross-chain transactions involve the following steps: 

1. Claim a cross-chain claim ID on the issuing chain.
2. Submit a commit transaction on the locking chain, attaching the claimed cross-chain claim ID and include a reward for the witness servers. This locks the asset on the locking chain.
3. Obtain the attestations from the witness servers that the transaction occurred on the issuing chain.
4. When there are enough signatures to reach quorum, the XRP is automatically released on the issuing chain to the destination account. In some cases, for example a trustline is not set up properly, or a deposit auth is set up, you need to submit a transaction claim for the transferred value on the issuing chain, attaching the attestation as proof that the value was indeed transferred.
5. The rewards are then distributed to the witness servers' accounts on the issuing chain.

# Cross Chain Bridging XLS-38d (SIDECHAINS) FAQS

### What is a Sidechain?

A sidechain is a separate blockchain that links the XRPL Mainnet chain (the “Mainchain”) to a sidechain (each a “Sidechain”), allowing for cross-chain exchanges of assets and information.

### What are Witness Servers?

“Witness Servers” validate transfers between “door wallets” that connect the Mainchain to each Sidechain.  A series of decentralized entities and individuals will operate Witness Servers.

### Are there risks associated with operating a Witness Server?

There are certain risks associated with operating a Witness Server for a Sidechain, including the following:

_Regulatory Considerations_:  Operating a Witness Server carries some regulatory risk.  A few risks are identified below, some of which pertain to regulatory regimes that only apply to projects that serve those located in the U.S.  U.S. regimes are identified here because they are commonly considered some of the strictest regulatory regimes in the world.

The regulatory regime in the U.S. concerning the operation of a “money transmitting business” requiring federal registration as a money service business (“MSB”) and state money transmitter licenses (“MTLs”) is unclear as it pertains to operating Witness Servers.  The Witness Servers are intended to be operated by a series of decentralized entities and persons.  Despite this intention, if a regulator determined that there was “centralized” control of the Witness Servers by a particular entity or coordinated group, it may deem such activity to be money transmission.  The U.S. Treasury Department recently issued a report identifying a series of factors it would consider when determining whether a particular project is “decentralized.”  See [2023 DeFi Illicit Finance Risk Assessment](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1391).  This recent regulatory guidance is important because it indicates that the U.S. Treasury recognizes that certain projects may be “decentralized” and if the operation of the Witness Servers is “decentralized” it may not be considered a “money transmitting business.”

While U.S. crypto regulations have consistently remained among the most stringent and aggressively enforced, other jurisdictions also  have regulation and laws relating to the transfer of “money” and other value.  For example, in March of 2022, U.K. regulatory authorities published a series of documentary guidance regarding crypto and decentralized finance.  See [Financial Stability in Focus: Cryptoassets and Decentralized Finance](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-in-focus/2022/march-2022).  More recently, in June of 2023, the E.U. formally adopted a regulatory framework which in part imposes codified rules and regulations pertaining to decentralized crypto platforms.  See [Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica).  For those considering operating a Witness Server, it is critical to stay informed and compliant with the specific requirements of each jurisdiction involved to effectively manage associated risks.

_Technology and Network Security_:  Those intending to run a Witness Server should be familiar with the technical and security aspects of doing so.  Before agreeing to run a Witness Server, one should fully understand the functionality, potential vulnerabilities, and necessary technological and security measures involved.

_Civil Liability_:  Operating a Witness Server, like participating in any blockchain project, carries an unspecified level of civil liability risk.  There has been an influx of plaintiffs’ lawsuits in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and it is difficult to evaluate what theories a particular plaintiffs’ attorney may implement in a civil lawsuit.  Regardless of any real or perceived civil liability risk, it should be noted that even a frivolous lawsuit could take time and money to respond.

### Should I seek independent advice before agreeing to operate a Witness Server?

Yes.  Any party considering running a Witness Server should seek independent legal and tax advice from experienced professionals.  Please note, that as the Witness Servers must mutually attest to confirm cross-chain transfers, they may be understood to operate as a common enterprise - as it is defined by US regulators.  In a common enterprise, joint and several liability may apply, meaning that each Witness Server could be held individually responsible for all liability or damages incurred.  Given the evolving regulatory landscape, it’s critical to consult with a legal professional who can help navigate the complex and changing global regulatory landscape associated with the expectations and obligations of running a Witness Server.  As with any blockchain project, please do your own research.  These FAQs are just general guidance and are not legal or tax advice.

### Who should not run a Witness Server?

You should not run a Witness Server if you are not experienced (or do not have access to experienced support) in blockchain, MSB and MTL regulations, and other applicable regulations and laws.  You should also not operate a Witness Server if you are not an experienced person or entity with technical and compliance expertise.  Few individuals are qualified and experienced enough to operate Witness Servers on their own.  You should also not operate a Witness Server if you have not sought and obtained independent legal and tax advice.

### Are these FAQs comprehensive and conclusive advice?

No. These FAQs are intended to provide general guidance and do not constitute technical, financial, or legal advice.  These FAQs should not be used as a substitute for professional advice tailored to one’s specific circumstances.  The blockchain and digital asset landscape is complex and constantly changing, which necessitates staying updated and seeking expert advice.  It is recommended that those engaging with a Sidechain regularly check official resources such as governmental and regulatory body websites.  Nonetheless, consulting with legal professionals who specialize in blockchain, and cryptocurrency is the most reliable way to get accurate and personalized advice.

| `MinAccountCreateAmount`   | `Currency Amount` | `AMOUNT`          | No        | The minimum amount, in XRP, required for an `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction. If this isn't present, the `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction will fail. This field can only be present on XRP-XRP bridges. |
| `SignatureReward`          | `Currency Amount` | `AMOUNT`          | Yes       | The total amount, in XRP, to be rewarded for providing a signature for cross-chain transfer or for signing for the cross-chain reward. This amount will be split among the signers. |

It is incremented every time a `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction is "claimed" on the destination chain. When the "claim" transaction is run on the destination chain, the `XChainAccountClaimCount` must match the value that the `XChainAccountCreateCount` had at the time the `XChainAccountClaimCount` was run on the source chain. This orders the claims so that they run in the same order that the `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transactions ran on the source chain, to prevent transaction replay. |
| `XChainAccountCreateCount` | `number`          | `UINT64`          | Yes       | A counter used to order the execution of account create transactions. It is incremented every time a successful `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction is run for the source chain. |

# XChainOwnedClaimID

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L281-L293 "Source")

An `XChainOwnedClaimID` object represents *one* cross-chain transfer of value and includes information of the account on the source chain that locks or burns the funds on the source chain.

The `XChainOwnedClaimID` object must be acquired on the destination chain before submitting a `XChainCommit` on the source chain. Its purpose is to prevent transaction replay attacks and is also used as a place to collect attestations from witness servers.

An `XChainCreateClaimID` transaction is used to create a new `XChainOwnedClaimID`. The ledger object is destroyed when the funds are successfully claimed on the destination chain.

# XChainOwnedCreateAccountClaimID

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/LedgerFormats.cpp#L296-L306 "Source")

The `XChainOwnedCreateAccountClaimID` ledger object is used to collect attestations for creating an account via a cross-chain transfer.

It is created when an `XChainAddAccountCreateAttestation` transaction adds a signature attesting to a `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction and the `XChainAccountCreateCount` is greater than or equal to the current `XChainAccountClaimCount` on the `Bridge` ledger object.

The ledger object is destroyed when all the attestations have been received and the funds have transferred to the new account.

This page lists the parallel networks available for testing interoperability features.

You can use the [XRP Ledger Custom Network Explorer](https://custom.xrpl.org/) to look up parallel network information, such as historical transactions, accounts, ledgers, fees, exchange rates, timestamps, sequence numbers, node uptime, IP addresses, topology, versions, and peers.

**Note:** If you need to monitor a network with custom transactions, or just want to run your own instance of the explorer, see the [README](https://github.com/ripple/explorer).

# XChainAccountCreateCommit

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/TxFormats.cpp#L414-L421 "Source")

This transaction can only be used for XRP-XRP bridges.

The `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction creates a new account for a witness server to submit transactions on an issuing chain.

**Warning:** This transaction should only be executed if the witness attestations will be reliably delivered to the destination chain. If the signatures aren't delivered, then account creation will be blocked until attestations are received. This can be used maliciously; to disable this transaction on XRP-XRP bridges, the bridge's `MinAccountCreateAmount` shouldn't be present.

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/TxFormats.cpp#L395-L411 "Source")

The `XChainAddAccountCreateAttestation` transaction provides an attestation from a witness server that a `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction occurred on the other chain.

The signature must be from one of the keys on the door's signer list at the time the signature was provided. If the signature list changes between the time the signature was submitted and the quorum is reached, the new signature set is used and some of the currently collected signatures may be removed.

Any account can submit signatures.

**Note:** The reward is only sent to accounts that have keys on the current list. A quorum of signers need to agree on the `SignatureReward`, the same way they need to agree on the other data. A single witness server can't provide an incorrect value for this in an attempt to collect a larger reward.

# XChainClaim

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/TxFormats.cpp#L366-L374 "Source")

The `XChainClaim` transaction completes a cross-chain transfer of value. It allows a user to claim the value on the destination chain - the equivalent of the value locked on the source chain. A user can only claim the value if they own the cross-chain claim ID associated with the value locked on the source chain (the `Account` field). The user can send the funds to anyone (the `Destination` field). This transaction is only needed if an `OtherChainDestination` isn't specified in the `XChainCommit` transaction, or if something goes wrong with the automatic transfer of funds.

If the transaction succeeds in moving funds, the referenced `XChainOwnedClaimID` ledger object will be destroyed. This prevents transaction replay. If the transaction fails, the `XChainOwnedClaimID` won't be destroyed and the transaction can be re-run with different parameters.

The `XChainCommit` is the second step in a cross-chain transfer. It puts assets into trust on the locking chain so that they can be wrapped on the issuing chain, or burns wrapped assets on the issuing chain so that they can be returned on the locking chain.

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/TxFormats.cpp#L329-L335 "Source")

The `XChainCreateBridge` transaction creates a new `Bridge` ledger object and defines a new cross-chain bridge entrance on the chain that the transaction is submitted on. It includes information about door accounts and assets for the bridge. 

The transaction must be submitted first by the locking chain door account. To set up a valid bridge, door accounts on both chains must submit this transaction, in addition to setting up witness servers.

The complete production-grade setup would also include a `SignerListSet` transaction on the two door accounts for the witnesses’ signing keys, as well as disabling the door accounts’ master key. This ensures that the witness servers are truly in control of the funds.

**Note:** Each door account can only have one bridge. This prevents the creation of duplicate bridges for the same asset, which can cause asset imbalances on either chain.

The `XChainCreateClaimID` transaction creates a new cross-chain claim ID that is used for a cross-chain transfer. A cross-chain claim ID represents *one* cross-chain transfer of value. 

This transaction is the first step of a cross-chain transfer of value and is submitted on the destination chain, not the source chain. 

It also includes the account on the source chain that locks or burns the funds on the source chain.

[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/rippled/blob/xbridge/src/ripple/protocol/impl/TxFormats.cpp#L338-L344 "Source")

The `XChainModifyBridge` transaction allows bridge managers to modify the parameters of the bridge. They can only change the `SignatureReward` and the `MinAccountCreateAmount`.

This transaction must be sent by the door account and requires the entities that control the witness servers to coordinate and provide the signatures for this transaction. This coordination happens outside the ledger.

**Note:** You can't modify the signer list for the bridge with this transaction. The signer list is on the door account itself and is changed in the same way signer lists are changed on accounts (via a `SignerListSet` transaction).

# Set Up an IOU-IOU Bridge

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

## Prerequisites

- An XRP-XRP bridge must be set up between the locking and issuing chain.
- Ensure the witnesses' transaction submission accounts are funded on the locking and issuing chains.
- Door accounts exist for the bridge on the locking and issuing chains.

## Steps

1. Submit an `XChainCreateBridge` transaction from the door account on the locking chain.
  
    **Note:** Don't include a `MinAccountCreateAmount` value.

2. Submit a `SignerListSet` transaction from the door account on the locking chain, using the witnesses' signing keys as the signers.
   
3. Disable the master key on the locking chain's door account with an `AccountSet` transaction.
   
4. Submit an `XChainCreateBridge` transaction from the door account on the issuing chain.

5. Submit a `SignerListSet` transaction from the door account on the issuing chain, using the witnesses' signing keys as the signers.

6. Disable the master key on the issuing chain's door account with an `AccountSet` transaction.

# Set Up an XRP-XRP Bridge

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

Setting up an XRP-XRP bridge on a new issuing chain is somewhat complex because there are no accounts on the issuing chain, even for witnesses. The issuing chain must use its genesis account as a door account to submit attestations and create transaction submission accounts for witnesses.

## Prerequisites

- The issuing chain is set up and active. Validators must be running and successfully closing ledgers.
- The witnesses' accounts on the locking chain are funded, so they can submit transactions.
- A door account for the bridge exists on the locking chain.

## Steps

1. Submit an `XChainCreateBridge` transaction from the door account on the locking chain.

    **Note:** The `MinAccountCreateAmount` value should at least be equal to the account reserve on the issuing chain.

2. Submit a `SignerListSet` transaction from the door account on the locking chain, using the witnesses' signing keys as the signers.

4. Disable the master key on the locking chain's door account with an `AccountSet` transaction.

5. Submit an `XChainCreateBridge` transaction from the genesis account on the issuing chain.

6. Submit `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transactions from the witnesses' locking chain accounts to create corresponding accounts on the issuing chain.

7. Create an attestation for each `XChainAccountCreateCommit` transaction. These attestations must be signed by the genesis seed.

    **Note:** This can also be done by a witness server that is set up to not submit transactions.

8.  Submit the attestations with the `XChainAddAccountCreateAttestation` transaction on the issuing chain, using the genesis account.

9.  Submit a `SignerListSet` transaction from the genesis account on the issuing chain, using the witnesses' signing keys as the signers.

10. Disable the master key on the issuing chain's genesis account with an `AccountSet` transaction.

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

## Prerequisites

- The locking and issuing chains are both up and running.
- The witness servers are up and running.
- Set up a bridge between the two chains.
- Enable the `XChainBridge` amendment in the `rippled.cfg` configuration file on both chains.
- You have an account on the locking and issuing chain.

## Steps

1. Create a claim ID with `XChainCreateClaimID`, using your account on the issuing chain.
   
2. Retrieve the claim ID from the transaction metadata, or use the `XChainCreateClaimID` RPC call.

3. Submit an `XChainCommit` transaction with the claim ID, using your account on the locking chain.

4. A witness server takes note of the `XChainCommit` transaction and submits an `XChainAddClaimAttestation` transaction on the issuing chain, attesting that the `XChainCommit` transaction did in fact occur on the locking chain.

5. When enough `XChainAddClaimAttestation` signatures are submitted to reach quorum, the funds are automatically released on the issuing chain to the `OtherChainDestination` specified by the `XChainCommit` transaction.

6. (Optional) If the funds aren't automatically released, you can submit an `XChainClaim` transaction with your account on the issuing chain.

# Witness Server
[[Source]](https://github.com/seelabs/xbridge_witness "Source")

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

A _witness server_ acts as a neutral witness for transactions between a locking chain and an issuing chain. It listens to the door accounts on both sides of a bridge and signs attestations that confirm a transaction occurred. They are essentially acting as an oracle to “prove” that value was locked or burned on a source account, which allows the recipient to then claim (via minting or unlocking) the equivalent funds on the destination account.

The bridge between the locking chain and the issuing chain includes the following information in its configuration: 

* Witness servers that monitor transactions on the bridge. You can choose one or more witness servers. 
* Fee for witness servers for their service.
 
Anyone can run a witness server. However, the burden is on the participants of the issuing chain to evaluate the reliability of witness servers. If you run a witness server, you must also run a `rippled` node and sync it to the chain the witness server needs access to.

**Note:** Issuing chains may choose to configure a bridge with only one witness server initially and run the witness server itself. This strategy is helpful in the initial period, when the issuing chain hasn't established itself yet in the marketplace.

## Witness Server Configuration

The witness server takes a JSON configuration file, specified using the `--conf` command-line argument.

# XRPL Sidechains

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

A sidechain is an independent ledger with its own consensus algorithm, transaction types, rules, and nodes (including validators). It acts as its own blockchain, running parallel to a mainchain, enabling value to move between the two without compromising the speed, efficiency, and throughput of the mainchain. In the context of XLS-38d, a sidechain is the issuing chain, and the mainchain is the locking chain.

Sidechains can customize the XRP Ledger protocol to the needs of a specific use case or project and run it as its own blockchain. Here are a few examples:

* Build a smart contract layer, powered by an engine compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), web assembly, or a Move VM. For example, a [smart sidechain with Hooks](https://hooks-testnet.xrpl-labs.com/) enabled.
* Build your own algorithmic stable coin with customised ledger types and transaction rules.
* Build permissioned or nearly permissionless, centralized or largely decentralized ledgers whose assets can be traded on the Mainnet [decentralized exchange](https://xrpl.org/decentralized-exchange.html).

## FAQ

- **Can I clone the rippled UNL to sync a sidechain node with?** No. Sidechains use their own validators and must use a separate UNL.

- **So, would mainchain validators need to vote on sidechain transactions?** No. Nodes on the mainchain have no knowledge of the sidechain. Door accounts on a mainchain are treated as standard multi-signature accounts.

- **Can I roll up transactions and have an entry on the mainchain?** Transactions on a sidechain aren't visible to nodes on the mainchain. Only transactions submitted from the sidechain door account to a destination on the mainchain are visible and will have an entry on the mainchain.

- **When will sidechains be available?** Cross-chain bridges and sidechains have been proposed to the XRPL community with [XLS-38d](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/92). You can test cross-chain bridge features on the [`sidechain devnet`](parallel-networks-list.md), using the public locking and issuing chains. You can also use the [`xbridge-cli`](https://github.com/XRPLF/xbridge-cli) tool to set up your own sidechain and witness servers to connect to the locking chain on `sidechain devnet`.
